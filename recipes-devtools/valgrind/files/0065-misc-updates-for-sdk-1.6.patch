-Valgrind FAQ
-Release 3.8.0 10 August 2012
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-Table of Contents
-1. Background
-2. Compiling, installing and configuring
-3. Valgrind aborts unexpectedly
-4. Valgrind behaves unexpectedly
-5. Miscellaneous
-6. How To Get Further Assistance
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-1. Background
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-1.1. How do you pronounce "Valgrind"? 
-The "Val" as in the world "value". The "grind" is pronounced with a 
-short 'i' -- ie. "grinned" (rhymes with "tinned") rather than "grined" 
-(rhymes with "find"). 
-
-Don't feel bad: almost everyone gets it wrong at first. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-1.2. Where does the name "Valgrind" come from? 
-From Nordic mythology. Originally (before release) the project was named 
-Heimdall, after the watchman of the Nordic gods. He could "see a hundred 
-miles by day or night, hear the grass growing, see the wool growing on a 
-sheep's back", etc. This would have been a great name, but it was 
-already taken by a security package "Heimdal". 
-
-Keeping with the Nordic theme, Valgrind was chosen. Valgrind is the name 
-of the main entrance to Valhalla (the Hall of the Chosen Slain in 
-Asgard). Over this entrance there resides a wolf and over it there is 
-the head of a boar and on it perches a huge eagle, whose eyes can see to 
-the far regions of the nine worlds. Only those judged worthy by the 
-guardians are allowed to pass through Valgrind. All others are refused 
-entrance. 
-
-It's not short for "value grinder", although that's not a bad guess. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-2. Compiling, installing and configuring
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-2.1. When building Valgrind, 'make' dies partway with an assertion 
-failure, something like this: 
-
-    % make: expand.c:489: allocated_variable_append: 
-            Assertion 'current_variable_set_list->next != 0' failed.
-    
-It's probably a bug in 'make'. Some, but not all, instances of version 
-3.79.1 have this bug, see this: 
-<http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-make@gnu.org/msg01658.html>. Try 
-upgrading to a more recent version of 'make'. Alternatively, we have 
-heard that unsetting the CFLAGS environment variable avoids the problem. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-2.2. When building Valgrind, 'make' fails with this: 
-    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lc
-    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
-    
-You need to install the glibc-static-devel package. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-3. Valgrind aborts unexpectedly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-3.1. Programs run OK on Valgrind, but at exit produce a bunch of errors 
-involving __libc_freeres and then die with a segmentation fault. 
-
-When the program exits, Valgrind runs the procedure __libc_freeres in 
-glibc. This is a hook for memory debuggers, so they can ask glibc to 
-free up any memory it has used. Doing that is needed to ensure that 
-Valgrind doesn't incorrectly report space leaks in glibc. 
-
-The problem is that running __libc_freeres in older glibc versions 
-causes this crash. 
-
-Workaround for 1.1.X and later versions of Valgrind: use the 
---run-libc-freeres=no option. You may then get space leak reports for 
-glibc allocations (please don't report these to the glibc people, since 
-they are not real leaks), but at least the program runs. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-3.2. My (buggy) program dies like this: 
-    valgrind: m_mallocfree.c:248 (get_bszB_as_is): Assertion 'bszB_lo == bszB_hi' failed.
-
-or like this: 
-    valgrind: m_mallocfree.c:442 (mk_inuse_bszB): Assertion 'bszB != 0' failed.
-
-or otherwise aborts or crashes in m_mallocfree.c. 
-If Memcheck (the memory checker) shows any invalid reads, invalid writes 
-or invalid frees in your program, the above may happen. Reason is that 
-your program may trash Valgrind's low-level memory manager, which then 
-dies with the above assertion, or something similar. The cure is to fix 
-your program so that it doesn't do any illegal memory accesses. The 
-above failure will hopefully go away after that. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-3.3. My program dies, printing a message like this along the way: 
-    vex x86->IR: unhandled instruction bytes: 0x66 0xF 0x2E 0x5
-
-One possibility is that your program has a bug and erroneously jumps to 
-a non-code address, in which case you'll get a SIGILL signal. Memcheck 
-may issue a warning just before this happens, but it might not if the 
-jump happens to land in addressable memory. 
-
-Another possibility is that Valgrind does not handle the instruction. If 
-you are using an older Valgrind, a newer version might handle the 
-instruction. However, all instruction sets have some obscure, rarely 
-used instructions. Also, on amd64 there are an almost limitless number 
-of combinations of redundant instruction prefixes, many of them 
-undocumented but accepted by CPUs. So Valgrind will still have decoding 
-failures from time to time. If this happens, please file a bug report. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-3.4. I tried running a Java program (or another program that uses a 
-just-in-time compiler) under Valgrind but something went wrong. Does 
-Valgrind handle such programs? 
-
-Valgrind can handle dynamically generated code, so long as none of the 
-generated code is later overwritten by other generated code. If this 
-happens, though, things will go wrong as Valgrind will continue running 
-its translations of the old code (this is true on x86 and amd64, on 
-PowerPC there are explicit cache flush instructions which Valgrind 
-detects and honours). You should try running with --smc-check=all in 
-this case. Valgrind will run much more slowly, but should detect the use 
-of the out-of-date code. 
-
-Alternatively, if you have the source code to the JIT compiler you can 
-insert calls to the VALGRIND_DISCARD_TRANSLATIONS client request to mark 
-out-of-date code, saving you from using --smc-check=all. 
-
-Apart from this, in theory Valgrind can run any Java program just fine, 
-even those that use JNI and are partially implemented in other languages 
-like C and C++. In practice, Java implementations tend to do nasty 
-things that most programs do not, and Valgrind sometimes falls over 
-these corner cases. 
-
-If your Java programs do not run under Valgrind, even with 
---smc-check=all, please file a bug report and hopefully we'll be able to 
-fix the problem. 
-
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-4. Valgrind behaves unexpectedly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-4.1. My program uses the C++ STL and string classes. Valgrind reports 
-'still reachable' memory leaks involving these classes at the exit of 
-the program, but there should be none. 
-
-First of all: relax, it's probably not a bug, but a feature. Many 
-implementations of the C++ standard libraries use their own memory pool 
-allocators. Memory for quite a number of destructed objects is not 
-immediately freed and given back to the OS, but kept in the pool(s) for 
-later re-use. The fact that the pools are not freed at the exit of the 
-program cause Valgrind to report this memory as still reachable. The 
-behaviour not to free pools at the exit could be called a bug of the 
-library though. 
-
-Using GCC, you can force the STL to use malloc and to free memory as 
-soon as possible by globally disabling memory caching. Beware! Doing so 
-will probably slow down your program, sometimes drastically. 
-
-* With GCC 2.91, 2.95, 3.0 and 3.1, compile all source using the STL 
-with -D__USE_MALLOC. Beware! This was removed from GCC starting with 
-version 3.3. 
-
-* With GCC 3.2.2 and later, you should export the environment variable 
-GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW before running your program. 
-
-* With GCC 3.4 and later, that variable has changed name to 
-GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW. 
-
-There are other ways to disable memory pooling: using the malloc_alloc 
-template with your objects (not portable, but should work for GCC) or 
-even writing your own memory allocators. But all this goes beyond the 
-scope of this FAQ. Start by reading 
-http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/faq/index.html#4_4_leak: 
-<http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/faq/index.html#4_4_leak> if you 
-absolutely want to do that. But beware: allocators belong to the more 
-messy parts of the STL and people went to great lengths to make the STL 
-portable across platforms. Chances are good that your solution will work 
-on your platform, but not on others. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-4.2. The stack traces given by Memcheck (or another tool) aren't 
-helpful. How can I improve them? 
-
-If they're not long enough, use --num-callers to make them longer. 
-If they're not detailed enough, make sure you are compiling with -g to 
-add debug information. And don't strip symbol tables (programs should be 
-unstripped unless you run 'strip' on them; some libraries ship 
-stripped). 
-
-Also, for leak reports involving shared objects, if the shared object is 
-unloaded before the program terminates, Valgrind will discard the debug 
-information and the error message will be full of ??? entries. The 
-workaround here is to avoid calling dlclose on these shared objects. 
-
-Also, -fomit-frame-pointer and -fstack-check can make stack traces 
-worse. 
-
-Some example sub-traces: 
-* With debug information and unstripped (best): 
-    Invalid write of size 1
-       at 0x80483BF: really (malloc1.c:20)
-       by 0x8048370: main (malloc1.c:9)
-    
-* With no debug information, unstripped: 
-    Invalid write of size 1

-
-4.3. The stack traces given by Memcheck (or another tool) seem to have 
-the wrong function name in them. What's happening? 
-
-Occasionally Valgrind stack traces get the wrong function names. This is 
-caused by glibc using aliases to effectively give one function two 
-names. Most of the time Valgrind chooses a suitable name, but very 
-occasionally it gets it wrong. Examples we know of are printing bcmp 
-instead of memcmp, index instead of strchr, and rindex instead of 
-strrchr. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-4.4. My program crashes normally, but doesn't under Valgrind, or vice 
-versa. What's happening? 
-
-When a program runs under Valgrind, its environment is slightly 
-different to when it runs natively. For example, the memory layout is 
-different, and the way that threads are scheduled is different. 
-
-Most of the time this doesn't make any difference, but it can, 
-particularly if your program is buggy. For example, if your program 
-crashes because it erroneously accesses memory that is unaddressable, 
-it's possible that this memory will not be unaddressable when run under 
-Valgrind. Alternatively, if your program has data races, these may not 
-manifest under Valgrind. 
-
-There isn't anything you can do to change this, it's just the nature of 
-the way Valgrind works that it cannot exactly replicate a native 
-execution environment. In the case where your program crashes due to a 
-memory error when run natively but not when run under Valgrind, in most 
-cases Memcheck should identify the bad memory operation. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-4.5. Memcheck doesn't report any errors and I know my program has 
-errors. 
-
-There are two possible causes of this. 
-First, by default, Valgrind only traces the top-level process. So if 
-your program spawns children, they won't be traced by Valgrind by 
-default. Also, if your program is started by a shell script, Perl 
-script, or something similar, Valgrind will trace the shell, or the Perl 
-interpreter, or equivalent. 
-
-To trace child processes, use the --trace-children=yes option. 
-If you are tracing large trees of processes, it can be less disruptive 
-to have the output sent over the network. Give Valgrind the option 
---log-socket=127.0.0.1:12345 (if you want logging output sent to port 
-12345 on localhost). You can use the valgrind-listener program to listen 
-on that port: 
-
-    valgrind-listener 12345
-    
-Obviously you have to start the listener process first. See the manual 
-for more details. 
-
-Second, if your program is statically linked, most Valgrind tools won't 
-work as well, because they won't be able to replace certain functions, 
-such as malloc, with their own versions. A key indicator of this is if 
-Memcheck says: All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible when 
-you know your program calls malloc. The workaround is to avoid 
-statically linking your program. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-4.6. Why doesn't Memcheck find the array overruns in this program? 
-    int static[5];
-    
-    int main(void)
-    {
-      int stack[5];
-    
-      static[5] = 0;
-      stack [5] = 0;
-              
-      return 0;
-    }
-    
-Unfortunately, Memcheck doesn't do bounds checking on global or stack 
-arrays. We'd like to, but it's just not possible to do in a reasonable 
-way that fits with how Memcheck works. Sorry. 
-
-However, the experimental tool SGcheck can detect errors like this. Run 
-Valgrind with the --tool=exp-sgcheck option to try it, but be aware that 
-it is not as robust as Memcheck. 
-
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-5. Miscellaneous
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-5.1. I tried writing a suppression but it didn't work. Can you write my 
-suppression for me? 
-
-Yes! Use the --gen-suppressions=yes feature to spit out suppressions 
-automatically for you. You can then edit them if you like, eg. combining 
-similar automatically generated suppressions using wildcards like '*'. 
-
-If you really want to write suppressions by hand, read the manual 
-carefully. Note particularly that C++ function names must be mangled 
-(that is, not demangled). 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-5.2. With Memcheck's memory leak detector, what's the difference between 
-"definitely lost", "indirectly lost", "possibly lost", "still 
-reachable", and "suppressed"? 
-
-The details are in the Memcheck section of the user manual. 
-In short: 
-* "definitely lost" means your program is leaking memory -- fix those 
-leaks! 
-
-* "indirectly lost" means your program is leaking memory in a 
-pointer-based structure. (E.g. if the root node of a binary tree is 
-"definitely lost", all the children will be "indirectly lost".) If you 
-fix the "definitely lost" leaks, the "indirectly lost" leaks should go 
-away. 
-
-* "possibly lost" means your program is leaking memory, unless you're 
-doing unusual things with pointers that could cause them to point into 
-the middle of an allocated block; see the user manual for some possible 
-causes. Use --show-possibly-lost=no if you don't want to see these 
-reports. 
-
-* "still reachable" means your program is probably ok -- it didn't free 
-some memory it could have. This is quite common and often reasonable. 
-Don't use --show-reachable=yes if you don't want to see these reports. 
-
-* "suppressed" means that a leak error has been suppressed. There are 
-some suppressions in the default suppression files. You can ignore 
-suppressed errors. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-5.3. Memcheck's uninitialised value errors are hard to track down, 
-because they are often reported some time after they are caused. Could 
-Memcheck record a trail of operations to better link the cause to the 
-effect? Or maybe just eagerly report any copies of uninitialised memory 
-values? 
-
-Prior to version 3.4.0, the answer was "we don't know how to do it 
-without huge performance penalties". As of 3.4.0, try using the 
---track-origins=yes option. It will run slower than usual, but will give 
-you extra information about the origin of uninitialised values. 
-
-Or if you want to do it the old fashioned way, you can use the client 
-request VALGRIND_CHECK_VALUE_IS_DEFINED to help track these errors down 
--- work backwards from the point where the uninitialised error occurs, 
-checking suspect values until you find the cause. This requires editing, 
-compiling and re-running your program multiple times, which is a pain, 
-but still easier than debugging the problem without Memcheck's help. 
-
-As for eager reporting of copies of uninitialised memory values, this 
-has been suggested multiple times. Unfortunately, almost all programs 
-legitimately copy uninitialised memory values around (because compilers 
-pad structs to preserve alignment) and eager checking leads to hundreds 
-of false positives. Therefore Memcheck does not support eager checking 
-at this time. 
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-5.4. Is it possible to attach Valgrind to a program that is already 
-running? 
-
-No. The environment that Valgrind provides for running programs is 
-significantly different to that for normal programs, e.g. due to 
-different layout of memory. Therefore Valgrind has to have full control 
-from the very start. 
-
-It is possible to achieve something like this by running your program 
-without any instrumentation (which involves a slow-down of about 5x, 
-less than that of most tools), and then adding instrumentation once you 
-get to a point of interest. Support for this must be provided by the 
-tool, however, and Callgrind is the only tool that currently has such 
-support. See the instructions on the callgrind_control program for 
-details.

-6. How To Get Further Assistance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-Read the appropriate section(s) of the Valgrind Documentation: 
-<http://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/index.html>. 
-
-Search: <http://search.gmane.org> the valgrind-users: 
-<http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.valgrind> mailing list 
-archives, using the group name gmane.comp.debugging.valgrind. 
-
-If you think an answer in this FAQ is incomplete or inaccurate, please 
-e-mail valgrind@valgrind.org: <valgrind@valgrind.org>. 
-
-If you have tried all of these things and are still stuck, you can try 
-mailing the valgrind-users mailing list: 
-<http://www.valgrind.org/support/mailing_lists.html>. Note that an email 
-has a better change of being answered usefully if it is clearly written. 
-Also remember that, despite the fact that most of the community are very 
-helpful and responsive to emailed questions, you are probably requesting 
-help from unpaid volunteers, so you have no guarantee of receiving an 
-answer.

-   A basic block is a linear section of code with one entry point and one exit
-   point.  A <span class="emphasis"><em>basic block vector</em></span> (BBV) is a list of all
-   basic blocks entered during program execution, and a count of how many
-   times each basic block was run.
-</p>
-<p>
-   BBV is a tool that generates basic block vectors for use with the 
-   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/~calder/simpoint/" target="_top">SimPoint</a>
-   analysis tool. 
-   The SimPoint methodology enables speeding up architectural 
-   simulations by only running a small portion of a program
-   and then extrapolating total behavior from this
-   small portion.  Most programs exhibit phase-based behavior, which
-   means that at various times during execution a program will encounter 
-   intervals of time where the code behaves similarly to a previous
-   interval.  If you can detect these intervals and group them together, 
-   an approximation of the total program behavior can be obtained
-   by only simulating a bare minimum number of intervals, and then scaling 
-   the results.
-</p>
-<p>
-  In computer architecture research, running a 
-  benchmark on a cycle-accurate simulator can cause slowdowns on the order
-  of 1000 times, making it take days, weeks, or even longer to run full
-  benchmarks.  By utilizing SimPoint this can be reduced significantly,
-  usually by 90-95%, while still retaining reasonable accuracy.
-</p>
-<p>
-   A more complete introduction to how SimPoint works can be 
-   found in the paper "Automatically Characterizing Large Scale 
-   Program Behavior" by T. Sherwood, E. Perelman, G. Hamerly, and 
-   B. Calder.

-<p>
-   To quickly create a basic block vector file, you will call Valgrind
-   like this:
-
-   </p>
-<pre class="programlisting">valgrind --tool=exp-bbv /bin/ls</pre>
-<p>
-
-   In this case we are running on <code class="filename">/bin/ls</code>,
-   but this can be any program.  By default a file called
-   <code class="computeroutput">bb.out.PID</code> will be created,
-   where PID is replaced by the process ID of the running process.
-   This file contains the basic block vector.  For long-running programs
-   this file can be quite large, so it might be wise to compress
-   it with gzip or some other compression program.
-</p>
-<p>
-   To create actual SimPoint results, you will need the SimPoint utility,
-   available from the 
-   <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/~calder/simpoint/" target="_top">SimPoint webpage</a>.
-   Assuming you have downloaded SimPoint 3.2 and compiled it,
-   create SimPoint results with a command like the following:
-      
-   </p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-./SimPoint.3.2/bin/simpoint -inputVectorsGzipped \
-    -loadFVFile bb.out.1234.gz \
-    -k 5 -saveSimpoints results.simpts \
-    -saveSimpointWeights results.weights</pre>
-<p>
-
-   where bb.out.1234.gz is your compressed basic block vector file
-   generated by BBV.
-</p>
-<p>   
-   The SimPoint utility does random linear projection using 15-dimensions,
-   then does k-mean clustering to calculate which intervals are 
-   of interest.  In this example we specify 5 intervals with the 
-   -k 5 option.   
-</p>
-<p>   
-   The outputs from the SimPoint run are the 
-   <code class="computeroutput">results.simpts</code>
-   and <code class="computeroutput">results.weights</code> files.
-   The first holds the 5 most relevant intervals of the program.
-   The seconds holds the weight to scale each interval by when
-   extrapolating full-program behavior.  The intervals and the weights
-   can be used in conjunction with a simulator that supports
-   fast-forwarding; you fast-forward to the interval of interest,
-   collect stats for the desired interval length, then use
-   statistics gathered in conjunction with the weights to 
-   calculate your results.

-         can lead to accuracy issues due to warm-up effects 
-         (When fast-forwarding the various architectural features

-  The Basic Block Vector is dumped at fixed intervals.  This
-  is commonly done every 100 million instructions; the 
-  <code class="option">--interval-size</code> option can be 
-  used to change this.
-</p>
-<p>
-  The output file looks like this:
-</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-T:45:1024 :189:99343
-T:11:78573 :15:1353  :56:1
-T:18:45 :12:135353 :56:78 314:4324263</pre>
-<p>
-  Each new interval starts with a T.   This is followed on the same line
-  by a series of basic block and frequency pairs, one for each
-  basic block that was entered during the interval.  The format for
-  each block/frequency pair is a colon, followed by a number that
-  uniquely identifies the basic block, another colon, and then
-  the frequency (which is the number of times the block was entered,
-  multiplied by the number of instructions in the block).  The
-  pairs are separated from each other by a space.
-</p>
-<p>
-  The frequency count is multiplied by the number of instructions that are 
-  in the basic block, in order to weigh the count so that instructions in 
-  small basic blocks aren't counted as more important than instructions 
-  in large basic blocks.
-</p>
-<p>
-  The SimPoint program only processes lines that start with a "T".  All
-  other lines are ignored.  Traditionally comments are indicated by
-  starting a line with a "#" character.  Some other BBV generation tools,
-  such as PinPoints, generate lines beginning with letters other than "T"
-  to indicate more information about the program being run.  We do
-  not generate these, as the SimPoint utility ignores them.

-<p>
-   Valgrind provides all of the information necessary to create
-   BBV files.  In the current implementation, all instructions
-   are instrumented.  This is slower (by approximately a factor
-   of two) than a method that instruments at the basic block level, 
-   but there are some complications (especially with rep prefix
-   detection) that make that method more difficult.
-</p>
-<p>
-   Valgrind actually provides instrumentation at a superblock level.
-   A superblock has one entry point but unlike basic blocks can
-   have multiple exit points.  Once a branch occurs into the middle
-   of a block, it is split into a new basic block.  Because
-   Valgrind cannot produce "true" basic blocks, the generated
-   BBV vectors will be different than those generated by other tools.
-   In practice this does not seem to affect the accuracy of the
-   SimPoint results.  We do internally force the
-   <code class="option">--vex-guest-chase-thresh=0</code>
-   option to Valgrind which forces a more basic-block-like
-   behavior.
-</p>
-<p>
-   When a superblock is run for the first time, it is instrumented
-   with our BBV routine.  A block info (bbInfo) structure is allocated
-   which holds the various information and statistics for the block.
-   A unique block ID is assigned to the block, and then the
-   structure is placed into an ordered set.
-   Then each native instruction in the block is instrumented to
-   call an instruction counting routine with a pointer to the block
-   info structure as an argument.
-</p>
-<p>
-   At run-time, our instruction counting routines are called once
-   per native instruction.  The relevant block info structure is accessed
-   and the block count and total instruction count is updated.   
-   If the total instruction count overflows the interval size 
-   then we walk the ordered set, writing out the statistics for
-   any block that was accessed in the interval, then resetting the
-   block counters to zero.
-</p>
-<p>
-   On the x86 and amd64 architectures the counting code has extra
-   code to handle rep-prefixed string instructions.  This is because 
-   actual hardware counts a rep-prefixed instruction 
-   as one instruction, while a naive Valgrind implementation
-   would count it as many (possibly hundreds, thousands or even millions)
-   of instructions.  We handle rep-prefixed instructions specially,
-   in order to make the results match those obtained with hardware performance
-   counters.
-</p>
-<p>
-   BBV also counts the fldcw instruction.  This instruction is used on 
-   x86 machines in various ways; it is most commonly found when converting 
-   floating point values into integers.
-   On Pentium 4 systems the retired instruction performance
-   counter counts this instruction as two instructions (all other 
-   known processors only count it as one).
-   This can affect results when using SimPoint on Pentium 4 systems.
-   We provide the fldcw count so that users can evaluate whether it
-   will impact their results enough to avoid using Pentium 4 machines
-   for their experiments.  It would be possible to add an option to 
-   this tool that mimics the double-counting so that the generated BBV
-   files would be usable for experiments using hardware performance
-   counters on Pentium 4 systems.

-<p>
-   BBV supports threaded programs.  When a program has multiple threads,
-   an additional basic block vector file is created for each thread (each
-   additional file is the specified filename with the thread number
-   appended at the end).
-</p>
-<p>
-   There is no official method of using SimPoint with
-   threaded workloads.  The most common method is to run
-   SimPoint on each thread's results independently, and use 
-   some method of deterministic execution to try to match the
-   original workload.  This should be possible with the current
-   BBV.

-<p>
-   BBV has been tested on x86, amd64, and ppc32 platforms.
-   An earlier version of BBV was tested in detail using
-   hardware performance counters, this work is described in a paper 
-   from the HiPEAC'08 conference, "Using Dynamic Binary Instrumentation 
-   to Generate Multi-Platform SimPoints: Methodology and Accuracy" by

-  Using this program slows down execution by roughly a factor of 40
-  over native execution.  This varies depending on the machine
-  used and the benchmark being run.
-  On the SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks running on a 3.4GHz Pentium D 
-  processor, the slowdown ranges from 24x (mcf) to 340x (vortex.2).

-<p>Cachegrind simulates how your program interacts with a machine's cache
-hierarchy and (optionally) branch predictor.  It simulates a machine with
-independent first-level instruction and data caches (I1 and D1), backed by a
-unified second-level cache (L2).  This exactly matches the configuration of
-many modern machines.</p>
-<p>However, some modern machines have three levels of cache.  For these
-machines (in the cases where Cachegrind can auto-detect the cache
-configuration) Cachegrind simulates the first-level and third-level caches.
-The reason for this choice is that the L3 cache has the most influence on
-runtime, as it masks accesses to main memory.  Furthermore, the L1 caches
-often have low associativity, so simulating them can detect cases where the
-code interacts badly with this cache (eg. traversing a matrix column-wise
-with the row length being a power of 2).</p>
-<p>Therefore, Cachegrind always refers to the I1, D1 and LL (last-level)
-caches.</p>
-<p>
-Cachegrind gathers the following statistics (abbreviations used for each statistic
-is given in parentheses):</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>I cache reads (<code class="computeroutput">Ir</code>,
-    which equals the number of instructions executed),
-    I1 cache read misses (<code class="computeroutput">I1mr</code>) and
-    LL cache instruction read misses (<code class="computeroutput">ILmr</code>).
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>D cache reads (<code class="computeroutput">Dr</code>, which
-    equals the number of memory reads),
-    D1 cache read misses (<code class="computeroutput">D1mr</code>), and
-    LL cache data read misses (<code class="computeroutput">DLmr</code>).
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>D cache writes (<code class="computeroutput">Dw</code>, which equals
-    the number of memory writes),
-    D1 cache write misses (<code class="computeroutput">D1mw</code>), and
-    LL cache data write misses (<code class="computeroutput">DLmw</code>).
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Conditional branches executed (<code class="computeroutput">Bc</code>) and
-    conditional branches mispredicted (<code class="computeroutput">Bcm</code>).
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Indirect branches executed (<code class="computeroutput">Bi</code>) and
-    indirect branches mispredicted (<code class="computeroutput">Bim</code>).
-    </p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>Note that D1 total accesses is given by
-<code class="computeroutput">D1mr</code> +
-<code class="computeroutput">D1mw</code>, and that LL total
-accesses is given by <code class="computeroutput">ILmr</code> +
-<code class="computeroutput">DLmr</code> +
-<code class="computeroutput">DLmw</code>.
-</p>
-<p>These statistics are presented for the entire program and for each
-function in the program.  You can also annotate each line of source code in
-the program with the counts that were caused directly by it.</p>
-<p>On a modern machine, an L1 miss will typically cost
-around 10 cycles, an LL miss can cost as much as 200
-cycles, and a mispredicted branch costs in the region of 10
-to 30 cycles.  Detailed cache and branch profiling can be very useful
-for understanding how your program interacts with the machine and thus how
-to make it faster.</p>
-<p>Also, since one instruction cache read is performed per
-instruction executed, you can find out how many instructions are
-executed per line, which can be useful for traditional profiling.</p>

-<p>First off, as for normal Valgrind use, you probably want to
-compile with debugging info (the
-<code class="option">-g</code> option).  But by contrast with
-normal Valgrind use, you probably do want to turn
-optimisation on, since you should profile your program as it will
-be normally run.</p>
-<p>Then, you need to run Cachegrind itself to gather the profiling
-information, and then run cg_annotate to get a detailed presentation of that
-information.  As an optional intermediate step, you can use cg_merge to sum
-together the outputs of multiple Cachegrind runs into a single file which
-you then use as the input for cg_annotate.  Alternatively, you can use
-cg_diff to difference the outputs of two Cachegrind runs into a signel file
-which you then use as the input for cg_annotate.</p>

-<p>Cache accesses for instruction fetches are summarised
-first, giving the number of fetches made (this is the number of
-instructions executed, which can be useful to know in its own
-right), the number of I1 misses, and the number of LL instruction
-(<code class="computeroutput">LLi</code>) misses.</p>
-<p>Cache accesses for data follow. The information is similar
-to that of the instruction fetches, except that the values are
-also shown split between reads and writes (note each row's
-<code class="computeroutput">rd</code> and
-<code class="computeroutput">wr</code> values add up to the row's
-total).</p>
-<p>Combined instruction and data figures for the LL cache
-follow that.  Note that the LL miss rate is computed relative to the total
-number of memory accesses, not the number of L1 misses.  I.e.  it is
-<code class="computeroutput">(ILmr + DLmr + DLmw) / (Ir + Dr + Dw)</code>
-not
-<code class="computeroutput">(ILmr + DLmr + DLmw) / (I1mr + D1mr + D1mw)</code>

-<p>As well as printing summary information, Cachegrind also writes
-more detailed profiling information to a file.  By default this file is named
-<code class="filename">cachegrind.out.&lt;pid&gt;</code> (where
-<code class="filename">&lt;pid&gt;</code> is the program's process ID), but its name
-can be changed with the <code class="option">--cachegrind-out-file</code> option.  This
-file is human-readable, but is intended to be interpreted by the
-accompanying program cg_annotate, described in the next section.</p>
-<p>The default <code class="computeroutput">.&lt;pid&gt;</code> suffix
-on the output file name serves two purposes.  Firstly, it means you 
-don't have to rename old log files that you don't want to overwrite.  
-Secondly, and more importantly, it allows correct profiling with the
-<code class="option">--trace-children=yes</code> option of

-<p>Each function

-that event (e.g. the third row shows that
-<code class="computeroutput">strcmp()</code> contains no
-instructions that write to memory). The name
-<code class="computeroutput">???</code> is used if the the file name
-and/or function name could not be determined from debugging
-information. If most of the entries have the form
-<code class="computeroutput">???:???</code> the program probably

-<p>It is worth noting that functions will come both from

-<p>(Although column widths are automatically minimised, a wide
-terminal is clearly useful.)</p>
-<p>Each source file is clearly marked
-(<code class="computeroutput">User-annotated source</code>) as
-having been chosen manually for annotation.  If the file was
-found in one of the directories specified with the
-<code class="option">-I</code>/<code class="option">--include</code> option, the directory
-and file are both given.</p>
-<p>Each line is annotated with its event counts.  Events not
-applicable for a line are represented by a dot.  This is useful
-for distinguishing between an event which cannot happen, and one
-which can but did not.</p>
-<p>Sometimes only a small section of a source file is
-executed.  To minimise uninteresting output, Cachegrind only shows
-annotated lines and lines within a small distance of annotated
-lines.  Gaps are marked with the line numbers so you know which
-part of a file the shown code comes from, eg:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-(figures and code for line 704)
--- line 704 ----------------------------------------
--- line 878 ----------------------------------------
-(figures and code for line 878)</pre>
-<p>The amount of context to show around annotated lines is
-controlled by the <code class="option">--context</code>
-option.</p>
-<p>To get automatic annotation, use the <code class="option">--auto=yes</code> option.
-cg_annotate will automatically annotate every source file it can
-find that is mentioned in the function-by-function summary.
-Therefore, the files chosen for auto-annotation are affected by
-the <code class="option">--sort</code> and
-<code class="option">--threshold</code> options.  Each
-source file is clearly marked (<code class="computeroutput">Auto-annotated
-source</code>) as being chosen automatically.  Any
-files that could not be found are mentioned at the end of the
-output, eg:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-The following files chosen for auto-annotation could not be found:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-  getc.c
-  ctype.c
-  ../sysdeps/generic/lockfile.c</pre>
-<p>This is quite common for library files, since libraries are
-usually compiled with debugging information, but the source files
-are often not present on a system.  If a file is chosen for
-annotation both manually and automatically, it
-is marked as <code class="computeroutput">User-annotated
-source</code>. Use the
-<code class="option">-I</code>/<code class="option">--include</code> option to tell Valgrind where
-to look for source files if the filenames found from the debugging
-information aren't specific enough.</p>
-<p>Beware that cg_annotate can take some time to digest large
-<code class="filename">cachegrind.out.&lt;pid&gt;</code> files,
-e.g. 30 seconds or more.  Also beware that auto-annotation can
-produce a lot of output if your program is large!</p>

-<p>Valgrind can annotate assembly code programs too, or annotate
-the assembly code generated for your C program.  Sometimes this is
-useful for understanding what is really happening when an
-interesting line of C code is translated into multiple
-instructions.</p>
-<p>To do this, you just need to assemble your
-<code class="computeroutput">.s</code> files with assembly-level debug
-information.  You can use compile with the <code class="option">-S</code> to compile C/C++
-programs to assembly code, and then assemble the assembly code files with
-<code class="option">-g</code> to achieve this.  You can then profile and annotate the
-assembly code source files in the same way as C/C++ source files.</p>

-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>If annotating at the assembler level, you might see
-    something like this:</p>

-<p>How can the third instruction be executed twice when

-    isn't.  Here's a dump of the executable, using
-    <code class="computeroutput">objdump -d</code>:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-      8048f25:       8d 45 f4                lea    0xfffffff4(%ebp),%eax

-    boundary, but pretended it didn't exist when adding debug

-    thinks that the <code class="computeroutput">movl
-    $0x1,0xffffffec(%ebp)</code> instruction covers the
-    address range 0x8048f2b--0x804833 by itself, and attributes

-cg_merge is a simple program which

-You can then examine the merged results using

-described above.  The merging functionality might be useful if you
-want to aggregate costs over multiple runs of the same program, or
-from a single parallel run with multiple instances of the same
-program.</p>
-<p>
-cg_merge is invoked as follows:
-</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-cg_merge -o outputfile file1 file2 file3 ...</pre>
-<p>
-It reads and checks <code class="computeroutput">file1</code>, then read
-and checks <code class="computeroutput">file2</code> and merges it into
-the running totals, then the same with
-<code class="computeroutput">file3</code>, etc.  The final results are
-written to <code class="computeroutput">outputfile</code>, or to standard
-out if no output file is specified.</p>
-<p>
-Costs are summed on a per-function, per-line and per-instruction
-basis.  Because of this, the order in which the input files does not
-matter, although you should take care to only mention each file once,
-since any file mentioned twice will be added in twice.</p>
-<p>
-cg_merge does not attempt to check
-that the input files come from runs of the same executable.  It will
-happily merge together profile files from completely unrelated
-programs.  It does however check that the
-<code class="computeroutput">Events:</code> lines of all the inputs are
-identical, so as to ensure that the addition of costs makes sense.
-For example, it would be nonsensical for it to add a number indicating
-D1 read references to a number from a different file indicating LL
-write misses.</p>
-<p>

-<p>
-cg_diff is a simple program which
-reads two profile files, as created by Cachegrind, finds the difference
-between them, and writes the results into another file in the same format.
-You can then examine the merged results using
-<code class="computeroutput">cg_annotate &lt;filename&gt;</code>, as
-described above.  This is very useful if you want to measure how a change to
-a program affected its performance.
-</p>
-<p>
-cg_diff is invoked as follows:
-</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-cg_diff file1 file2</pre>
-<p>
-It reads and checks <code class="computeroutput">file1</code>, then read
-and checks <code class="computeroutput">file2</code>, then computes the
-difference (effectively <code class="computeroutput">file1</code> -
-<code class="computeroutput">file2</code>).  The final results are written to
-standard output.</p>
-<p>
-Costs are summed on a per-function basis.  Per-line costs are not summed,
-because doing so is too difficult.  For example, consider differencing two
-profiles, one from a single-file program A, and one from the same program A
-where a single blank line was inserted at the top of the file.  Every single
-per-line count has changed.  In comparison, the per-function counts have not
-changed.  The per-function count differences are still very useful for
-determining differences between programs.  Note that because the result is
-the difference of two profiles, many of the counts will be negative;  this
-indicates that the counts for the relevant function are fewer in the second
-version than those in the first version.</p>
-<p>
-cg_diff does not attempt to check
-that the input files come from runs of the same executable.  It will
-happily merge together profile files from completely unrelated
-programs.  It does however check that the
-<code class="computeroutput">Events:</code> lines of all the inputs are
-identical, so as to ensure that the addition of costs makes sense.
-For example, it would be nonsensical for it to add a number indicating
-D1 read references to a number from a different file indicating LL

-<p>
-A number of other syntax and sanity checks are done whilst reading the
-inputs.  cg_diff will stop and
-attempt to print a helpful error message if any of the input files
-fail these checks.</p>
-<p>
-Sometimes you will want to compare Cachegrind profiles of two versions of a
-program that you have sitting side-by-side.  For example, you might have
-<code class="computeroutput">version1/prog.c</code> and
-<code class="computeroutput">version2/prog.c</code>, where the second is
-slightly different to the first.  A straight comparison of the two will not
-be useful -- because functions are qualified with filenames, a function
-<code class="function">f</code> will be listed as
-<code class="computeroutput">version1/prog.c:f</code> for the first version but
-<code class="computeroutput">version2/prog.c:f</code> for the second
-version.</p>
-<p>
-When this happens, you can use the <code class="option">--mod-filename</code> option.
-Its argument is a Perl search-and-replace expression that will be applied
-to all the filenames in both Cachegrind output files.  It can be used to
-remove minor differences in filenames.  For example, the option
-<code class="option">--mod-filename='s/version[0-9]/versionN/'</code> will suffice for
-this case.</p>
-<p>
-Similarly, sometimes compilers auto-generate certain functions and give them
-randomized names.  For example, GCC sometimes auto-generates functions with
-names like <code class="function">T.1234</code>, and the suffixes vary from build to
-build.  You can use the <code class="option">--mod-funcname</code> option to remove
-small differences like these;  it works in the same way as
-<code class="option">--mod-filename</code>.</p>

-<a name="cg-manual.acting-on"></a>5.6.Acting on Cachegrind's Information</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>
-Cachegrind gives you lots of information, but acting on that information
-isn't always easy.  Here are some rules of thumb that we have found to be
-useful.</p>
-<p>
-First of all, the global hit/miss counts and miss rates are not that useful.
-If you have multiple programs or multiple runs of a program, comparing the
-numbers might identify if any are outliers and worthy of closer
-investigation.  Otherwise, they're not enough to act on.</p>
-<p>
-The function-by-function counts are more useful to look at, as they pinpoint
-which functions are causing large numbers of counts.  However, beware that
-inlining can make these counts misleading.  If a function
-<code class="function">f</code> is always inlined, counts will be attributed to the
-functions it is inlined into, rather than itself.  However, if you look at
-the line-by-line annotations for <code class="function">f</code> you'll see the
-counts that belong to <code class="function">f</code>.  (This is hard to avoid, it's
-how the debug info is structured.)  So it's worth looking for large numbers
-in the line-by-line annotations.</p>
-<p>
-The line-by-line source code annotations are much more useful.  In our
-experience, the best place to start is by looking at the
-<code class="computeroutput">Ir</code> numbers.  They simply measure how many
-instructions were executed for each line, and don't include any cache
-information, but they can still be very useful for identifying
-bottlenecks.</p>
-<p>
-After that, we have found that LL misses are typically a much bigger source
-of slow-downs than L1 misses.  So it's worth looking for any snippets of
-code with high <code class="computeroutput">DLmr</code> or
-<code class="computeroutput">DLmw</code> counts.  (You can use
-<code class="option">--show=DLmr
---sort=DLmr</code> with cg_annotate to focus just on
-<code class="literal">DLmr</code> counts, for example.) If you find any, it's still
-not always easy to work out how to improve things.  You need to have a
-reasonable understanding of how caches work, the principles of locality, and
-your program's data access patterns.  Improving things may require
-redesigning a data structure, for example.</p>
-<p>
-Looking at the <code class="computeroutput">Bcm</code> and
-<code class="computeroutput">Bim</code> misses can also be helpful.
-In particular, <code class="computeroutput">Bim</code> misses are often caused
-by <code class="literal">switch</code> statements, and in some cases these
-<code class="literal">switch</code> statements can be replaced with table-driven code.
-For example, you might replace code like this:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-enum E { A, B, C };
-enum E e;
-int i;
-...
-switch (e)
-{
-    case A: i += 1; break;
-    case B: i += 2; break;
-    case C: i += 3; break;
-}
-</pre>
-<p>with code like this:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-enum E { A, B, C };
-enum E e;
-enum E table[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
-int i;
-...
-i += table[e];
-</pre>
-<p>
-This is obviously a contrived example, but the basic principle applies in a
-wide variety of situations.</p>
-<p>
-In short, Cachegrind can tell you where some of the bottlenecks in your code
-are, but it can't tell you how to fix them.  You have to work that out for
-yourself.  But at least you have the information!

-<a name="cache-sim"></a>5.7.1.Cache Simulation Specifics</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Specific characteristics of the cache simulation are as
-follows:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>Write-allocate: when a write miss occurs, the block
-    written to is brought into the D1 cache.  Most modern caches
-    have this property.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Bit-selection hash function: the set of line(s) in the cache
-    to which a memory block maps is chosen by the middle bits
-    M--(M+N-1) of the byte address, where:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle">
-<li class="listitem"><p>line size = 2^M bytes</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>(cache size / line size / associativity) = 2^N bytes</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Inclusive LL cache: the LL cache typically replicates all
-    the entries of the L1 caches, because fetching into L1 involves
-    fetching into LL first (this does not guarantee strict inclusiveness,
-    as lines evicted from LL still could reside in L1).  This is
-    standard on Pentium chips, but AMD Opterons, Athlons and Durons
-    use an exclusive LL cache that only holds
-    blocks evicted from L1.  Ditto most modern VIA CPUs.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>The cache configuration simulated (cache size,
-associativity and line size) is determined automatically using
-the x86 CPUID instruction.  If you have a machine that (a)
-doesn't support the CPUID instruction, or (b) supports it in an
-early incarnation that doesn't give any cache information, then
-Cachegrind will fall back to using a default configuration (that
-of a model 3/4 Athlon).  Cachegrind will tell you if this
-happens.  You can manually specify one, two or all three levels
-(I1/D1/LL) of the cache from the command line using the
-<code class="option">--I1</code>,
-<code class="option">--D1</code> and
-<code class="option">--LL</code> options.
-For cache parameters to be valid for simulation, the number
-of sets (with associativity being the number of cache lines in
-each set) has to be a power of two.</p>
-<p>On PowerPC platforms
-Cachegrind cannot automatically 
-determine the cache configuration, so you will 
-need to specify it with the
-<code class="option">--I1</code>,
-<code class="option">--D1</code> and
-<code class="option">--LL</code> options.</p>
-<p>Other noteworthy behaviour:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">

-<li class="listitem"><p>If one block hits, the other misses --&gt; counted
-        as one miss.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>If both blocks miss --&gt; counted as one miss (not

-</li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Instructions that modify a memory location
-    (e.g. <code class="computeroutput">inc</code> and
-    <code class="computeroutput">dec</code>) are counted as doing
-    just a read, i.e. a single data reference.  This may seem
-    strange, but since the write can never cause a miss (the read
-    guarantees the block is in the cache) it's not very
-    interesting.</p>
-<p>Thus it measures not the number of times the data cache

-<p>Cachegrind simulates branch predictors intended to be
-typical of mainstream desktop/server processors of around 2004.</p>
-<p>Conditional branches are predicted using an array of 16384 2-bit
-saturating counters.  The array index used for a branch instruction is
-computed partly from the low-order bits of the branch instruction's
-address and partly using the taken/not-taken behaviour of the last few
-conditional branches.  As a result the predictions for any specific
-branch depend both on its own history and the behaviour of previous
-branches.  This is a standard technique for improving prediction
-accuracy.</p>
-<p>For indirect branches (that is, jumps to unknown destinations)
-Cachegrind uses a simple branch target address predictor.  Targets are
-predicted using an array of 512 entries indexed by the low order 9
-bits of the branch instruction's address.  Each branch is predicted to
-jump to the same address it did last time.  Any other behaviour causes
-a mispredict.</p>
-<p>More recent processors have better branch predictors, in
-particular better indirect branch predictors.  Cachegrind's predictor
-design is deliberately conservative so as to be representative of the
-large installed base of processors which pre-date widespread
-deployment of more sophisticated indirect branch predictors.  In
-particular, late model Pentium 4s (Prescott), Pentium M, Core and Core
-2 have more sophisticated indirect branch predictors than modelled by
-Cachegrind.  </p>
-<p>Cachegrind does not simulate a return stack predictor.  It
-assumes that processors perfectly predict function return addresses,
-an assumption which is probably close to being true.</p>
-<p>See Hennessy and Patterson's classic text "Computer
-Architecture: A Quantitative Approach", 4th edition (2007), Section
-2.3 (pages 80-89) for background on modern branch predictors.</p>

-<p>Valgrind's cache profiling has a number of
-shortcomings:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>It doesn't account for kernel activity -- the effect of system
-    calls on the cache and branch predictor contents is ignored.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>It doesn't account for other process activity.
-    This is probably desirable when considering a single
-    program.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>It doesn't account for virtual-to-physical address
-    mappings.  Hence the simulation is not a true
-    representation of what's happening in the
-    cache.  Most caches and branch predictors are physically indexed, but
-    Cachegrind simulates caches using virtual addresses.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>It doesn't account for cache misses not visible at the
-    instruction level, e.g. those arising from TLB misses, or
-    speculative execution.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Valgrind will schedule
-    threads differently from how they would be when running natively.
-    This could warp the results for threaded programs.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>The x86/amd64 instructions <code class="computeroutput">bts</code>,
-    <code class="computeroutput">btr</code> and
-    <code class="computeroutput">btc</code> will incorrectly be
-    counted as doing a data read if both the arguments are
-    registers, eg:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-    btsl %eax, %edx</pre>
-<p>This should only happen rarely.</p>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>x86/amd64 FPU instructions with data sizes of 28 and 108 bytes

-    though they only access 16 bytes.  These instructions seem to
-    be rare so hopefully this won't affect accuracy much.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>Another thing worth noting is that results are very sensitive.
-Changing the size of the the executable being profiled, or the sizes
-of any of the shared libraries it uses, or even the length of their
-file names, can perturb the results.  Variations will be small, but
-don't expect perfectly repeatable results if your program changes at
-all.</p>
-<p>More recent GNU/Linux distributions do address space
-randomisation, in which identical runs of the same program have their
-shared libraries loaded at different locations, as a security measure.
-This also perturbs the results.</p>
-<p>While these factors mean you shouldn't trust the results to
-be super-accurate, they should be close enough to be useful.</p>

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="cg-manual.impl-details.how-cg-works"></a>5.8.1.How Cachegrind Works</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>The best reference for understanding how Cachegrind works is chapter 3 of
-"Dynamic Binary Analysis and Instrumentation", by Nicholas Nethercote.  It
-is available on the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.valgrind.org/docs/pubs.html" target="_top">Valgrind publications
-page</a>.</p>

-<div class="sect2" title="5.8.2.Cachegrind Output File Format">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="cg-manual.impl-details.file-format"></a>5.8.2.Cachegrind Output File Format</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>The file format is fairly straightforward, basically giving the
-cost centre for every line, grouped by files and
-functions.  It's also totally generic and self-describing, in the sense that
-it can be used for any events that can be counted on a line-by-line basis,
-not just cache and branch predictor events.  For example, earlier versions
-of Cachegrind didn't have a branch predictor simulation.  When this was
-added, the file format didn't need to change at all.  So the format (and
-consequently, cg_annotate) could be used by other tools.</p>
-<p>The file format:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-file         ::= desc_line* cmd_line events_line data_line+ summary_line
-desc_line    ::= "desc:" ws? non_nl_string
-cmd_line     ::= "cmd:" ws? cmd
-events_line  ::= "events:" ws? (event ws)+
-data_line    ::= file_line | fn_line | count_line
-file_line    ::= "fl=" filename
-fn_line      ::= "fn=" fn_name
-count_line   ::= line_num ws? (count ws)+
-summary_line ::= "summary:" ws? (count ws)+
-count        ::= num | "."</pre>
-<p>Where:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="computeroutput">non_nl_string</code> is any
-    string not containing a newline.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="computeroutput">cmd</code> is a string holding the
-    command line of the profiled program.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="computeroutput">event</code> is a string containing
-    no whitespace.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="computeroutput">filename</code> and
-    <code class="computeroutput">fn_name</code> are strings.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="computeroutput">num</code> and
-    <code class="computeroutput">line_num</code> are decimal
-    numbers.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="computeroutput">ws</code> is whitespace.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>The contents of the "desc:" lines are printed out at the top
-of the summary.  This is a generic way of providing simulation
-specific information, e.g. for giving the cache configuration for
-cache simulation.</p>
-<p>More than one line of info can be presented for each file/fn/line number.
-In such cases, the counts for the named events will be accumulated.</p>
-<p>Counts can be "." to represent zero.  This makes the files easier for
-humans to read.</p>
-<p>The number of counts in each
-<code class="computeroutput">line</code> and the
-<code class="computeroutput">summary_line</code> should not exceed
-the number of events in the
-<code class="computeroutput">event_line</code>.  If the number in
-each <code class="computeroutput">line</code> is less, cg_annotate
-treats those missing as though they were a "." entry.  This saves space.
-</p>
-<p>A <code class="computeroutput">file_line</code> changes the
-current file name.  A <code class="computeroutput">fn_line</code>
-changes the current function name.  A
-<code class="computeroutput">count_line</code> contains counts that
-pertain to the current filename/fn_name.  A "fn="
-<code class="computeroutput">file_line</code> and a
-<code class="computeroutput">fn_line</code> must appear before any
-<code class="computeroutput">count_line</code>s to give the context
-of the first <code class="computeroutput">count_line</code>s.</p>
-<p>Each <code class="computeroutput">file_line</code> will normally be
-immediately followed by a <code class="computeroutput">fn_line</code>.  But it
-doesn't have to be.</p>
-<p>The summary line is redundant, because it just holds the total counts
-for each event.  But this serves as a useful sanity check of the data;  if
-the totals for each event don't match the summary line, something has gone
-wrong.</p>

-<p>This chapter describes the Callgrind Profile Format, Version 1.</p>
-<p>A synonymous name is "Calltree Profile Format". These names actually mean
-the same since Callgrind was previously named Calltree.</p>
-<p>The format description is meant for the user to be able to understand the
-file contents; but more important, it is given for authors of measurement or
-visualization tools to be able to write and read this format.</p>
-<div class="sect1" title="3.1.Overview">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="cl-format.overview"></a>3.1.Overview</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>The profile data format is ASCII based.
-It is written by Callgrind, and it is upwards compatible
-to the format used by Cachegrind (ie. Cachegrind uses a subset). It can
-be read by callgrind_annotate and KCachegrind.</p>
-<p>This chapter gives on overview of format features and examples.
-For detailed syntax, look at the format reference.</p>
-<div class="sect2" title="3.1.1.Basic Structure">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="cl-format.overview.basics"></a>3.1.1.Basic Structure</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Each file has a header part of an arbitrary number of lines of the
-format "key: value". The lines with key "positions" and "events" define
-the meaning of cost lines in the second part of the file: the value of
-"positions" is a list of subpositions, and the value of "events" is a list
-of event type names. Cost lines consist of subpositions followed by 64-bit
-counters for the events, in the order specified by the "positions" and "events"
-header line.</p>
-<p>The "events" header line is always required in contrast to the optional
-line for "positions", which defaults to "line", i.e. a line number of some
-source file. In addition, the second part of the file contains position
-specifications of the form "spec=name". "spec" can be e.g. "fn" for a
-function name or "fl" for a file name. Cost lines are always related to
-the function/file specifications given directly before.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="3.1.2.Simple Example">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="cl-format.overview.example1"></a>3.1.2.Simple Example</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>The event names in the following example are quite arbitrary, and are not
-related to event names used by Callgrind. Especially, cycle counts matching
-real processors probably will never be generated by any Valgrind tools, as these
-are bound to simulations of simple machine models for acceptable slowdown.
-However, any profiling tool could use the format described in this chapter.</p>
-<p>
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">events: Cycles Instructions Flops
-fl=file.f
-fn=main
-15 90 14 2
-16 20 12</pre>
-<p>The above example gives profile information for event types "Cycles",
-"Instructions", and "Flops". Thus, cost lines give the number of CPU cycles
-passed by, number of executed instructions, and number of floating point
-operations executed while running code corresponding to some source
-position. As there is no line specifying the value of "positions", it defaults
-to "line", which means that the first number of a cost line is always a line
-number.</p>
-<p>Thus, the first cost line specifies that in line 15 of source file
-<code class="filename">file.f</code> there is code belonging to function
-<code class="function">main</code>. While running, 90 CPU cycles passed by, and 2 of
-the 14 instructions executed were floating point operations. Similarly, the
-next line specifies that there were 12 instructions executed in the context
-of function <code class="function">main</code> which can be related to line 16 in
-file <code class="filename">file.f</code>, taking 20 CPU cycles. If a cost line
-specifies less event counts than given in the "events" line, the rest is
-assumed to be zero.  I.e. there was no floating point instruction executed
-relating to line 16.</p>
-<p>Note that regular cost lines always give self (also called exclusive)
-cost of code at a given position. If you specify multiple cost lines for the
-same position, these will be summed up. On the other hand, in the example above
-there is no specification of how many times function
-<code class="function">main</code> actually was
-called: profile data only contains sums.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="3.1.3.Associations">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="cl-format.overview.associations"></a>3.1.3.Associations</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>The most important extension to the original format of Cachegrind is the
-ability to specify call relationship among functions. More generally, you
-specify associations among positions. For this, the second part of the
-file also can contain association specifications. These look similar to
-position specifications, but consist of 2 lines. For calls, the format
-looks like 
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
- calls=(Call Count) (Destination position)
- (Source position) (Inclusive cost of call)
-</pre>
-<p>The destination only specifies subpositions like line number. Therefore,
-to be able to specify a call to another function in another source file, you
-have to precede the above lines with a "cfn=" specification for the name of the
-called function, and a "cfl=" specification if the function is in another
-source file. The 2nd line looks like a regular cost line with the difference
-that inclusive cost spent inside of the function call has to be specified.</p>
-<p>Other associations are for example (conditional) jumps. See the
-reference below for details.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="3.1.4.Extended Example">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="cl-format.overview.example2"></a>3.1.4.Extended Example</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>The following example shows 3 functions, <code class="function">main</code>,
-<code class="function">func1</code>, and <code class="function">func2</code>. Function
-<code class="function">main</code> calls <code class="function">func1</code> once and
-<code class="function">func2</code> 3 times. <code class="function">func1</code> calls
-<code class="function">func2</code> 2 times.
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">events: Instructions
-
-fl=file1.c
-fn=main
-16 20
-cfn=func1
-calls=1 50
-16 400
-cfl=file2.c
-cfn=func2
-calls=3 20
-16 400
-
-fn=func1
-51 100
-cfl=file2.c
-cfn=func2
-calls=2 20
-51 300
-
-fl=file2.c
-fn=func2
-20 700</pre>
-<p>One can see that in <code class="function">main</code> only code from line 16
-is executed where also the other functions are called. Inclusive cost of
-<code class="function">main</code> is 820, which is the sum of self cost 20 and costs
-spent in the calls: 400 for the single call to <code class="function">func1</code>
-and 400 as sum for the three calls to <code class="function">func2</code>.</p>
-<p>Function <code class="function">func1</code> is located in
-<code class="filename">file1.c</code>, the same as <code class="function">main</code>.
-Therefore, a "cfl=" specification for the call to <code class="function">func1</code>
-is not needed. The function <code class="function">func1</code> only consists of code
-at line 51 of <code class="filename">file1.c</code>, where <code class="function">func2</code>
-is called.</p>
-</div>

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="cl-format.overview.compression1"></a>3.1.5.Name Compression</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>With the introduction of association specifications like calls it is
-needed to specify the same function or same file name multiple times. As
-absolute filenames or symbol names in C++ can be quite long, it is advantageous
-to be able to specify integer IDs for position specifications.
-Here, the term "position" corresponds to a file name (source or object file)
-or function name.</p>
-<p>To support name compression, a position specification can be not only of
-the format "spec=name", but also "spec=(ID) name" to specify a mapping of an
-integer ID to a name, and "spec=(ID)" to reference a previously defined ID
-mapping. There is a separate ID mapping for each position specification,
-i.e. you can use ID 1 for both a file name and a symbol name.</p>
-<p>With string compression, the example from 1.4 looks like this:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">events: Instructions
-
-fl=(1) file1.c
-fn=(1) main
-16 20
-cfn=(2) func1
-calls=1 50
-16 400
-cfl=(2) file2.c
-cfn=(3) func2
-calls=3 20
-16 400
-
-fn=(2)
-51 100
-cfl=(2)
-cfn=(3)
-calls=2 20
-51 300
-
-fl=(2)
-fn=(3)
-20 700</pre>
-<p>As position specifications carry no information themselves, but only change
-the meaning of subsequent cost lines or associations, they can appear
-everywhere in the file without any negative consequence. Especially, you can
-define name compression mappings directly after the header, and before any cost
-lines. Thus, the above example can also be written as
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">events: Instructions
-
-# define file ID mapping
-fl=(1) file1.c
-fl=(2) file2.c
-# define function ID mapping
-fn=(1) main
-fn=(2) func1
-fn=(3) func2
-
-fl=(1)
-fn=(1)
-16 20
-...</pre>

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="cl-format.overview.compression2"></a>3.1.6.Subposition Compression</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>If a Callgrind data file should hold costs for each assembler instruction
-of a program, you specify subposition "instr" in the "positions:" header line,
-and each cost line has to include the address of some instruction. Addresses
-are allowed to have a size of 64 bits to support 64-bit architectures. Thus,
-repeating similar, long addresses for almost every line in the data file can
-enlarge the file size quite significantly, and
-motivates for subposition compression: instead of every cost line starting with
-a 16 character long address, one is allowed to specify relative addresses.
-This relative specification is not only allowed for instruction addresses, but
-also for line numbers; both addresses and line numbers are called "subpositions".</p>
-<p>A relative subposition always is based on the corresponding subposition
-of the last cost line, and starts with a "+" to specify a positive difference,
-a "-" to specify a negative difference, or consists of "*" to specify the same
-subposition. Because absolute subpositions always are positive (ie. never
-prefixed by "-"), any relative specification is non-ambiguous; additionally,
-absolute and relative subposition specifications can be mixed freely.
-Assume the following example (subpositions can always be specified
-as hexadecimal numbers, beginning with "0x"):
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">positions: instr line
-events: ticks
-
-fn=func
-0x80001234 90 1
-0x80001237 90 5
-0x80001238 91 6</pre>
-<p>With subposition compression, this looks like
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">positions: instr line
-events: ticks
-
-fn=func
-0x80001234 90 1
-+3 * 5
-+1 +1 6</pre>
-<p>Remark: For assembler annotation to work, instruction addresses have to
-be corrected to correspond to addresses found in the original binary. I.e. for
-relocatable shared objects, often a load offset has to be subtracted.</p>

-<p>For the visualization to be able to show cost percentage, a sum of the
-cost of the full run has to be known. Usually, it is assumed that this is the
-sum of all cost lines in a file. But sometimes, this is not correct. Thus, you
-can specify a "summary:" line in the header giving the full cost for the
-profile run. This has another effect: a import filter can show a progress bar
-while loading a large data file if he knows to cost sum in advance.</p>

-<p>Event types for cost lines are specified in the "events:" line with an
-abbreviated name. For visualization, it makes sense to be able to specify some
-longer, more descriptive name. For an event type "Ir" which means "Instruction
-Fetches", this can be specified the header line
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">event: Ir : Instruction Fetches
-events: Ir Dr</pre>
-<p>In this example, "Dr" itself has no long name associated. The order of
-"event:" lines and the "events:" line is of no importance. Additionally,
-inherited event types can be introduced for which no raw data is available, but
-which are calculated from given types. Suppose the last example, you could add
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">event: Sum = Ir + Dr</pre>
-<p>
-to specify an additional event type "Sum", which is calculated by adding costs
-for "Ir and "Dr".</p>

-<p>There are the types "I1 cache", "D1 cache", "LL cache", which

-    Type "Trigger" states the reason of why this trace was generated.

-<li class="listitem">
-<p><code class="computeroutput">positions: [instr] [line]</code> [Callgrind]</p>
-<p>For cost lines, this defines the semantic of the first numbers. 
-    Any combination of "instr", "bb" and "line" is allowed, but has to be 
-    in this order which corresponds to position numbers at the start of 
-    the cost lines later in the file.</p>
-<p>If "instr" is specified, the position is the address of an 
-    instruction whose execution raised the events given later on the 
-    line.  This address is relative to the offset of the binary/shared 
-    library file to not have to specify relocation info.  For "line", 
-    the position is the line number of a source file, which is 
-    responsible for the events raised. Note that the mapping of "instr"
-    and "line" positions are given by the debugging line information
-    produced by the compiler.</p>

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="cl-manual.use"></a>6.1.Overview</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Callgrind is a profiling tool that records the call history among
-functions in a program's run as a call-graph.
-By default, the collected data consists of
-the number of instructions executed, their relationship
-to source lines, the caller/callee relationship between functions,
-and the numbers of such calls.
-Optionally, cache simulation and/or branch prediction (similar to Cachegrind)
-can produce further information about the runtime behavior of an application.
-</p>
-<p>The profile data is written out to a file at program
-termination. For presentation of the data, and interactive control
-of the profiling, two command line tools are provided:</p>
-<div class="variablelist"><dl>
-<dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>callgrind_annotate</strong></span></span></dt>
-<dd>
-<p>This command reads in the profile data, and prints a
-    sorted lists of functions, optionally with source annotation.</p>
-<p>For graphical visualization of the data, try
-    <a class="ulink" href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi/KcacheGrindIndex" target="_top">KCachegrind</a>, which is a KDE/Qt based
-    GUI that makes it easy to navigate the large amount of data that
-    Callgrind produces.</p>
-</dd>
-<dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>callgrind_control</strong></span></span></dt>
-<dd><p>This command enables you to interactively observe and control 
-    the status of a program currently running under Callgrind's control,
-    without stopping the program.  You can get statistics information as
-    well as the current stack trace, and you can request zeroing of counters
-    or dumping of profile data.</p></dd>
-</dl></div>
-<div class="sect2" title="6.1.1.Functionality">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="cl-manual.functionality"></a>6.1.1.Functionality</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Cachegrind collects flat profile data: event counts (data reads,
-cache misses, etc.) are attributed directly to the function they
-occurred in.  This cost attribution mechanism is
-called <span class="emphasis"><em>self</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>exclusive</em></span>
-attribution.</p>
-<p>Callgrind extends this functionality by propagating costs
-across function call boundaries.  If function <code class="function">foo</code> calls
-<code class="function">bar</code>, the costs from <code class="function">bar</code> are added into
-<code class="function">foo</code>'s costs.  When applied to the program as a whole,
-this builds up a picture of so called <span class="emphasis"><em>inclusive</em></span>
-costs, that is, where the cost of each function includes the costs of
-all functions it called, directly or indirectly.</p>
-<p>As an example, the inclusive cost of
-<code class="function">main</code> should be almost 100 percent
-of the total program cost.  Because of costs arising before 
-<code class="function">main</code> is run, such as
-initialization of the run time linker and construction of global C++
-objects, the inclusive cost of <code class="function">main</code>
-is not exactly 100 percent of the total program cost.</p>
-<p>Together with the call graph, this allows you to find the
-specific call chains starting from
-<code class="function">main</code> in which the majority of the
-program's costs occur.  Caller/callee cost attribution is also useful
-for profiling functions called from multiple call sites, and where
-optimization opportunities depend on changing code in the callers, in
-particular by reducing the call count.</p>
-<p>Callgrind's cache simulation is based on that of Cachegrind.
-Read the documentation for <a class="xref" href="cg-manual.html" title="5.Cachegrind: a cache and branch-prediction profiler">Cachegrind: a cache and branch-prediction profiler</a> first.  The material
-below describes the features supported in addition to Cachegrind's
-features.</p>
-<p>Callgrind's ability to detect function calls and returns depends
-on the instruction set of the platform it is run on.  It works best on
-x86 and amd64, and unfortunately currently does not work so well on
-PowerPC, ARM, Thumb or MIPS code.  This is because there are no explicit
-call or return instructions in these instruction sets, so Callgrind
-has to rely on heuristics to detect calls and returns.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="6.1.2.Basic Usage">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="cl-manual.basics"></a>6.1.2.Basic Usage</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>As with Cachegrind, you probably want to compile with debugging info
-  (the <code class="option">-g</code> option) and with optimization turned on.</p>

-<p>While the simulation is running, you can observe execution with:
-  </p>
-<pre class="screen">callgrind_control -b</pre>
-<p>
-  This will print out the current backtrace. To annotate the backtrace with
-  event counts, run
-  </p>
-<pre class="screen">callgrind_control -e -b</pre>
-<p>
-  </p>
-<p>After program termination, a profile data file named 
-  <code class="computeroutput">callgrind.out.&lt;pid&gt;</code>
-  is generated, where <span class="emphasis"><em>pid</em></span> is the process ID 
-  of the program being profiled.
-  The data file contains information about the calls made in the
-  program among the functions executed, together with 
-  <span class="command"><strong>Instruction Read</strong></span> (Ir) event counts.</p>
-<p>To generate a function-by-function summary from the profile
-  data file, use
-  </p>
-<pre class="screen">callgrind_annotate [options] callgrind.out.&lt;pid&gt;</pre>
-<p>
-  This summary is similar to the output you get from a Cachegrind
-  run with cg_annotate: the list
-  of functions is ordered by exclusive cost of functions, which also
-  are the ones that are shown.
-  Important for the additional features of Callgrind are
-  the following two options:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="option">--inclusive=yes</code>: Instead of using
-      exclusive cost of functions as sorting order, use and show
-      inclusive cost.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="option">--tree=both</code>: Interleave into the
-      top level list of functions, information on the callers and the callees
-      of each function. In these lines, which represents executed
-      calls, the cost gives the number of events spent in the call.
-      Indented, above each function, there is the list of callers,
-      and below, the list of callees. The sum of events in calls to
-      a given function (caller lines), as well as the sum of events in
-      calls from the function (callee lines) together with the self
-      cost, gives the total inclusive cost of the function.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>Use <code class="option">--auto=yes</code> to get annotated source code
-  for all relevant functions for which the source can be found. In
-  addition to source annotation as produced by
-  <code class="computeroutput">cg_annotate</code>, you will see the
-  annotated call sites with call counts. For all other options, 
-  consult the (Cachegrind) documentation for
-  <code class="computeroutput">cg_annotate</code>.
-  </p>
-<p>For better call graph browsing experience, it is highly recommended
-  to use <a class="ulink" href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi/KcacheGrindIndex" target="_top">KCachegrind</a>.
-  If your code
-  has a significant fraction of its cost in <span class="emphasis"><em>cycles</em></span> (sets
-  of functions calling each other in a recursive manner), you have to
-  use KCachegrind, as <code class="computeroutput">callgrind_annotate</code>
-  currently does not do any cycle detection, which is important to get correct
-  results in this case.</p>
-<p>If you are additionally interested in measuring the 
-  cache behavior of your program, use Callgrind with the option
-  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#clopt.cache-sim">--cache-sim</a>=yes</code>. For
-  branch prediction simulation, use <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#clopt.branch-sim">--branch-sim</a>=yes</code>.
-  Expect a further slow down approximately by a factor of 2.</p>
-<p>If the program section you want to profile is somewhere in the
-  middle of the run, it is beneficial to 
-  <span class="emphasis"><em>fast forward</em></span> to this section without any 
-  profiling, and then enable profiling.  This is achieved by using
-  the command line option
-  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.instr-atstart">--instr-atstart</a>=no</code> 
-  and running, in a shell:
-  <code class="computeroutput">callgrind_control -i on</code> just before the 
-  interesting code section is executed. To exactly specify
-  the code position where profiling should start, use the client request
-  <code class="computeroutput"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#cr.start-instr">CALLGRIND_START_INSTRUMENTATION</a></code>.</p>
-<p>If you want to be able to see assembly code level annotation, specify
-  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.dump-instr">--dump-instr</a>=yes</code>. This will produce
-  profile data at instruction granularity. Note that the resulting profile
-  data
-  can only be viewed with KCachegrind. For assembly annotation, it also is
-  interesting to see more details of the control flow inside of functions,
-  i.e. (conditional) jumps. This will be collected by further specifying
-  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.collect-jumps">--collect-jumps</a>=yes</code>.</p>

-<p>Sometimes you are not interested in characteristics of a full

-  algorithm.  If there are multiple algorithms, or one algorithm 
-  running with different input data, it may even be useful to get different
-  profile information for different parts of a single program run.</p>
-<p>Profile data files have names of the form
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-callgrind.out.<span class="emphasis"><em>pid</em></span>.<span class="emphasis"><em>part</em></span>-<span class="emphasis"><em>threadID</em></span>
-</pre>
-<p>
-  </p>
-<p>where <span class="emphasis"><em>pid</em></span> is the PID of the running 
-  program, <span class="emphasis"><em>part</em></span> is a number incremented on each
-  dump (".part" is skipped for the dump at program termination), and 
-  <span class="emphasis"><em>threadID</em></span> is a thread identification 
-  ("-threadID" is only used if you request dumps of individual 
-  threads with <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.separate-threads">--separate-threads</a>=yes</code>).</p>
-<p>There are different ways to generate multiple profile dumps 
-  while a program is running under Callgrind's supervision.  Nevertheless,
-  all methods trigger the same action, which is "dump all profile 
-  information since the last dump or program start, and zero cost 
-  counters afterwards".  To allow for zeroing cost counters without
-  dumping, there is a second action "zero all cost counters now". 
-  The different methods are:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>Dump on program termination.</strong></span>
-      This method is the standard way and doesn't need any special

-<pre class="screen">callgrind_control -d [hint [PID/Name]]</pre>

-      application with PID or Name.  <span class="emphasis"><em>hint</em></span> is an

-<a name="cl-manual.limits"></a>6.2.2.Limiting the range of collected events</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>For aggregating events (function enter/leave,
-  instruction execution, memory access) into event numbers,
-  first, the events must be recognizable by Callgrind, and second,
-  the collection state must be enabled.</p>
-<p>Event collection is only possible if <span class="emphasis"><em>instrumentation</em></span>
-  for program code is enabled. This is the default, but for faster
-  execution (identical to <code class="computeroutput">valgrind --tool=none</code>),
-  it can be disabled until the program reaches a state in which
-  you want to start collecting profiling data.  
-  Callgrind can start without instrumentation
-  by specifying option <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.instr-atstart">--instr-atstart</a>=no</code>.
-  Instrumentation can be enabled interactively
-  with: </p>
-<pre class="screen">callgrind_control -i on</pre>
-<p>
-  and off by specifying "off" instead of "on".
-  Furthermore, instrumentation state can be programatically changed with
-  the macros <code class="computeroutput"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#cr.start-instr">CALLGRIND_START_INSTRUMENTATION</a>;</code>
-  and <code class="computeroutput"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#cr.stop-instr">CALLGRIND_STOP_INSTRUMENTATION</a>;</code>.
-  </p>
-<p>In addition to enabling instrumentation, you must also enable
-  event collection for the parts of your program you are interested in.
-  By default, event collection is enabled everywhere.
-  You can limit collection to a specific function
-  by using 
-  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.toggle-collect">--toggle-collect</a>=function</code>. 
-  This will toggle the collection state on entering and leaving
-  the specified functions.
-  When this option is in effect, the default collection state
-  at program start is "off".  Only events happening while running
-  inside of the given function will be collected. Recursive
-  calls of the given function do not trigger any action.</p>
-<p>It is important to note that with instrumentation disabled, the
-  cache simulator cannot see any memory access events, and thus, any
-  simulated cache state will be frozen and wrong without instrumentation.
-  Therefore, to get useful cache events (hits/misses) after switching on
-  instrumentation, the cache first must warm up,
-  probably leading to many <span class="emphasis"><em>cold misses</em></span>
-  which would not have happened in reality. If you do not want to see these,
-  start event collection a few million instructions after you have enabled
-  instrumentation.</p>

-<p>For access to shared data among threads in a multithreaded

-<p>To enable analysis of this problem, Callgrind optionally can count
-  the number of atomic instructions executed. More precisely, for x86/x86_64,
-  these are instructions using a lock prefix. For architectures supporting
-  LL/SC, these are the number of SC instructions executed. For both, the term
-  "global bus events" is used.</p>
-<p>The short name of the event type used for global bus events is "Ge".

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="cl-manual.cycles"></a>6.2.4.Avoiding cycles</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Informally speaking, a cycle is a group of functions which
-  call each other in a recursive way.</p>
-<p>Formally speaking, a cycle is a nonempty set S of functions,
-  such that for every pair of functions F and G in S, it is possible
-  to call from F to G (possibly via intermediate functions) and also
-  from G to F.  Furthermore, S must be maximal -- that is, be the
-  largest set of functions satisfying this property.  For example, if
-  a third function H is called from inside S and calls back into S,
-  then H is also part of the cycle and should be included in S.</p>
-<p>Recursion is quite usual in programs, and therefore, cycles
-  sometimes appear in the call graph output of Callgrind. However,
-  the title of this chapter should raise two questions: What is bad
-  about cycles which makes you want to avoid them? And: How can
-  cycles be avoided without changing program code?</p>
-<p>Cycles are not bad in itself, but tend to make performance
-  analysis of your code harder. This is because inclusive costs
-  for calls inside of a cycle are meaningless. The definition of
-  inclusive cost, i.e. self cost of a function plus inclusive cost
-  of its callees, needs a topological order among functions. For
-  cycles, this does not hold true: callees of a function in a cycle include
-  the function itself. Therefore, KCachegrind does cycle detection
-  and skips visualization of any inclusive cost for calls inside
-  of cycles. Further, all functions in a cycle are collapsed into artifical
-  functions called like <code class="computeroutput">Cycle 1</code>.</p>
-<p>Now, when a program exposes really big cycles (as is
-  true for some GUI code, or in general code using event or callback based
-  programming style), you lose the nice property to let you pinpoint
-  the bottlenecks by following call chains from
-  <code class="function">main</code>, guided via
-  inclusive cost. In addition, KCachegrind loses its ability to show
-  interesting parts of the call graph, as it uses inclusive costs to
-  cut off uninteresting areas.</p>
-<p>Despite the meaningless of inclusive costs in cycles, the big
-  drawback for visualization motivates the possibility to temporarily
-  switch off cycle detection in KCachegrind, which can lead to
-  misguiding visualization. However, often cycles appear because of
-  unlucky superposition of independent call chains in a way that
-  the profile result will see a cycle. Neglecting uninteresting
-  calls with very small measured inclusive cost would break these
-  cycles. In such cases, incorrect handling of cycles by not detecting
-  them still gives meaningful profiling visualization.</p>
-<p>It has to be noted that currently, <span class="command"><strong>callgrind_annotate</strong></span>
-  does not do any cycle detection at all. For program executions with function
-  recursion, it e.g. can print nonsense inclusive costs way above 100%.</p>
-<p>After describing why cycles are bad for profiling, it is worth
-  talking about cycle avoidance. The key insight here is that symbols in
-  the profile data do not have to exactly match the symbols found in the
-  program. Instead, the symbol name could encode additional information
-  from the current execution context such as recursion level of the
-  current function, or even some part of the call chain leading to the
-  function. While encoding of additional information into symbols is
-  quite capable of avoiding cycles, it has to be used carefully to not cause
-  symbol explosion. The latter imposes large memory requirement for Callgrind
-  with possible out-of-memory conditions, and big profile data files.</p>
-<p>A further possibility to avoid cycles in Callgrind's profile data
-  output is to simply leave out given functions in the call graph. Of course, this
-  also skips any call information from and to an ignored function, and thus can
-  break a cycle. Candidates for this typically are dispatcher functions in event
-  driven code. The option to ignore calls to a function is
-  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.fn-skip">--fn-skip</a>=function</code>. Aside from
-  possibly breaking cycles, this is used in Callgrind to skip
-  trampoline functions in the PLT sections
-  for calls to functions in shared libraries. You can see the difference
-  if you profile with <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.skip-plt">--skip-plt</a>=no</code>.
-  If a call is ignored, its cost events will be propagated to the
-  enclosing function.</p>
-<p>If you have a recursive function, you can distinguish the first
-  10 recursion levels by specifying
-  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.separate-recs-num">--separate-recs10</a>=function</code>.  
-  Or for all functions with 
-  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.separate-recs">--separate-recs</a>=10</code>, but this will 
-  give you much bigger profile data files.  In the profile data, you will see
-  the recursion levels of "func" as the different functions with names
-  "func", "func'2", "func'3" and so on.</p>
-<p>If you have call chains "A &gt; B &gt; C" and "A &gt; C &gt; B"
-  in your program, you usually get a "false" cycle "B &lt;&gt; C". Use 
-  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.separate-callers-num">--separate-callers2</a>=B</code> 
-  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.separate-callers-num">--separate-callers2</a>=C</code>,
-  and functions "B" and "C" will be treated as different functions 
-  depending on the direct caller. Using the apostrophe for appending 
-  this "context" to the function name, you get "A &gt; B'A &gt; C'B" 
-  and "A &gt; C'A &gt; B'C", and there will be no cycle. Use 
-  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="cl-manual.html#opt.separate-callers">--separate-callers</a>=2</code> to get a 2-caller 
-  dependency for all functions.  Note that doing this will increase
-  the size of profile data files.</p>

-<dd><p>Specify whether cache line use should be collected. For every
-      cache line, from loading to it being evicted, the number of accesses
-      as well as the number of actually used bytes is determined. This
-      behavior is related to the code which triggered loading of the cache
-      line. In contrast to miss counters, which shows the position where
-      the symptoms of bad cache behavior (i.e. latencies) happens, the
-      use counters try to pinpoint at the reason (i.e. the code with the
-      bad access behavior). The new counters are defined in a way such
-      that worse behavior results in higher cost.
-      AcCost1 and AcCost2 are counters showing bad temporal locality
-      for L1 and LL caches, respectively. This is done by summing up
-      reciprocal values of the numbers of accesses of each cache line,
-      multiplied by 1000 (as only integer costs are allowed). E.g. for
-      a given source line with 5 read accesses, a value of 5000 AcCost
-      means that for every access, a new cache line was loaded and directly
-      evicted afterwards without further accesses. Similarly, SpLoss1/2
-      shows bad spatial locality for L1 and LL caches, respectively. It
-      gives the <span class="emphasis"><em>spatial loss</em></span> count of bytes which
-      were loaded into cache but never accessed. It pinpoints at code
-      accessing data in a way such that cache space is wasted. This hints
-      at bad layout of data structures in memory. Assuming a cache line
-      size of 64 bytes and 100 L1 misses for a given source line, the
-      loading of 6400 bytes into L1 was triggered. If SpLoss1 shows a
-      value of 3200 for this line, this means that half of the loaded data was
-      never used, or using a better data layout, only half of the cache
-      space would have been needed.
-      Please note that for cache line use counters, it currently is
-      not possible to provide meaningful inclusive costs. Therefore,
-      inclusive cost of these counters should be ignored.

-<p>DHAT is a tool for examining how programs use their heap
-allocations.</p>
-<p>It tracks the allocated blocks, and inspects every memory access
-to find which block, if any, it is to.  The following data is
-collected and presented per allocation point (allocation
-stack):</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>Total allocation (number of bytes and
-  blocks)</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>maximum live volume (number of bytes and
-  blocks)</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>average block lifetime (number of instructions
-   between allocation and freeing)</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>average number of reads and writes to each byte in
-   the block ("access ratios")</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>for allocation points which always allocate blocks
-   only of one size, and that size is 4096 bytes or less: counts
-   showing how often each byte offset inside the block is
-   accessed.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>Using these statistics it is possible to identify allocation
-points with the following characteristics:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>potential process-lifetime leaks: blocks allocated
-   by the point just accumulate, and are freed only at the end of the
-   run.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>excessive turnover: points which chew through a lot
-  of heap, even if it is not held onto for very long</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>excessively transient: points which allocate very
- short lived blocks</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>useless or underused allocations: blocks which are
-  allocated but not completely filled in, or are filled in but not
-  subsequently read.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>blocks with inefficient layout -- areas never
-  accessed, or with hot fields scattered throughout the
-  block.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>As with the Massif heap profiler, DHAT measures program progress
-by counting instructions, and so presents all age/time related figures
-as instruction counts.  This sounds a little odd at first, but it
-makes runs repeatable in a way which is not possible if CPU time is
-used.</p>

-<p>DHAT provides a lot of useful information on dynamic heap usage.
-Most of the art of using it is in interpretation of the resulting
-numbers.  That is best illustrated via a set of examples.</p>

-<p>Over the entire run of the program, this stack (allocation
-point) allocated 29,520 blocks in total, containing 1,904,700 bytes in
-total.  By looking at the max-live data, we see that not many blocks
-were simultaneously live, though: at the peak, there were 63,490
-allocated bytes in 984 blocks.  This tells us that the program is
-steadily freeing such blocks as it runs, rather than hanging on to all
-of them until the end and freeing them all.</p>
-<p>The deaths entry tells us that 29,520 blocks allocated by this stack
-died (were freed) during the run of the program.  Since 29,520 is
-also the number of blocks allocated in total, that tells us that
-all allocated blocks were freed by the end of the program.</p>
-<p>It also tells us that the average age at death was 22,227,424
-instructions.  From the summary statistics we see that the program ran
-for 1,045,339,534 instructions, and so the average age at death is
-about 2% of the program's total run time.</p>

-<p>This next example (from a different program than the above)
-shows a potential process lifetime leak.  A process lifetime leak
-occurs when a program keeps allocating data, but only frees the
-data just before it exits.  Hence the program's heap grows constantly
-in size, yet Memcheck reports no leak, because the program has
-freed up everything at exit.  This is particularly a hazard for
-long running programs.</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-   ======== SUMMARY STATISTICS ========
-   
-   guest_insns:  418,901,537

-   max-live:    32,512 in 254 blocks
-   tot-alloc:   32,512 in 254 blocks (avg size 128.00)

-</pre>
-<p>There are two tell-tale signs that this might be a
-process-lifetime leak.  Firstly, the max-live and tot-alloc numbers
-are identical.  The only way that can happen is if these blocks are
-all allocated and then all deallocated.</p>
-<p>Secondly, the average age at death (300 million insns) is 71% of
-the total program lifetime (419 million insns), hence this is not a
-transient allocation-free spike -- rather, it is spread out over a
-large part of the entire run.  One interpretation is, roughly, that
-all 254 blocks were allocated in the first half of the run, held onto
-for the second half, and then freed just before exit.</p>

-</pre>
-<p>The acc-ratios field tells us that each byte in the blocks
-allocated here is read an average of 2.13 times before the block is
-deallocated.  Given that the blocks have an average age at death of
-34,611,026, that's one read per block per approximately every 15
-million instructions.  So from that standpoint the blocks aren't
-"working" very hard.</p>
-<p>More interesting is the write ratio: each byte is written an
-average of 0.91 times.  This tells us that some parts of the allocated
-blocks are never written, at least 9% on average.  To completely
-initialise the block would require writing each byte at least once,
-and that would give a write ratio of 1.0.  The fact that some block
-areas are evidently unused might point to data alignment holes or
-other layout inefficiencies.</p>
-<p>Well, at least all the blocks are freed (24,240 allocations,
-24,240 deaths).</p>
-<p>If all the blocks had been the same size, DHAT would also show
-the access counts by block offset, so we could see where exactly these
-unused areas are.  However, that isn't the case: the blocks have
-varying sizes, so DHAT can't perform such an analysis.  We can see
-that they must have varying sizes since the average block size, 61.13,
-isn't a whole number.</p>

-<pre class="screen">
-   max-live:    180,224 in 22 blocks
-   tot-alloc:   180,224 in 22 blocks (avg size 8192.00)
-   deaths:      none (none of these blocks were freed)
-   acc-ratios:  0.00 rd, 0.00 wr  (0 b-read, 0 b-written)

-</pre>
-<p>Here, both the read and write access ratios are zero.  Hence
-this point is allocating blocks which are never used, neither read nor
-written.  Indeed, they are also not freed ("deaths: none") and are
-simply leaked.  So, here is 180k of completely useless allocation that
-could be removed.</p>
-<p>Re-running with Memcheck does indeed report the same leak.  What
-DHAT can tell us, that Memcheck can't, is that not only are the blocks
-leaked, they are also never used.</p>

-<a name="id604774"></a>10.2.2.3.Another suspicious example</h4></div></div></div></div>
-<p>Here's one where blocks are allocated, written to,
-but never read from.  We see this immediately from the zero read
-access ratio.  They do get freed, though:</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-   max-live:    54 in 3 blocks
-   tot-alloc:   1,620 in 90 blocks (avg size 18.00)
-   deaths:      90, at avg age 34,558,236
-   acc-ratios:  0.00 rd, 1.11 wr  (0 b-read, 1,800 b-written)
-      at 0x4C275B8: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:236)
-      by 0x40350E: tcc_malloc (tinycc.c:6712)
-      by 0x4035BD: tcc_strdup (tinycc.c:6750)
-      by 0x41FEBB: tcc_add_sysinclude_path (tinycc.c:20931)
-</pre>
-<p>In the previous two examples, it is easy to see blocks that are
-never written to, or never read from, or some combination of both.
-Unfortunately, in C++ code, the situation is less clear.  That's
-because an object's constructor will write to the underlying block,
-and its destructor will read from it.  So the block's read and write
-ratios will be non-zero even if the object, once constructed, is never
-used, but only eventually destructed.</p>
-<p>Really, what we want is to measure only memory accesses in
-between the end of an object's construction and the start of its
-destruction.  Unfortunately I do not know of a reliable way to
-determine when those transitions are made.</p>

-<p>For allocation points that always allocate blocks of the same
-size, and which are 4096 bytes or smaller, DHAT counts accesses
-per offset, for example:</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-   max-live:    317,408 in 5,668 blocks
-   tot-alloc:   317,408 in 5,668 blocks (avg size 56.00)
-   deaths:      5,668, at avg age 622,890,597
-   acc-ratios:  1.03 rd, 1.28 wr  (327,642 b-read, 408,172 b-written)
-      at 0x4C275B8: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:236)
-      by 0x5440C16: QDesignerPropertySheetPrivate::ensureInfo (qhash.h:515)
-      by 0x544350B: QDesignerPropertySheet::setVisible (qdesigner_propertysh...)
-      by 0x5446232: QDesignerPropertySheet::QDesignerPropertySheet (qdesigne...)
-   
-   Aggregated access counts by offset:
-   
-   [   0]  28782 28782 28782 28782 28782 28782 28782 28782
-   [   8]  20638 20638 20638 20638 0 0 0 0 
-   [  16]  22738 22738 22738 22738 22738 22738 22738 22738
-   [  24]  6013 6013 6013 6013 6013 6013 6013 6013 
-   [  32]  18883 18883 18883 37422 0 0 0 0
-   [  36]  5668 11915 5668 5668 11336 11336 11336 11336 
-   [  48]  6166 6166 6166 6166 0 0 0 0 
-</pre>
-<p>This is fairly typical, for C++ code running on a 64-bit
-platform.  Here, we have aggregated access statistics for 5668 blocks,
-all of size 56 bytes.  Each byte has been accessed at least 5668
-times, except for offsets 12--15, 36--39 and 52--55.  These are likely
-to be alignment holes.</p>
-<p>Careful interpretation of the numbers reveals useful information.
-Groups of N consecutive identical numbers that begin at an N-aligned
-offset, for N being 2, 4 or 8, are likely to indicate an N-byte object
-in the structure at that point.  For example, the first 32 bytes of
-this object are likely to have the layout</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-   [0 ]  64-bit type
-   [8 ]  32-bit type
-   [12]  32-bit alignment hole
-   [16]  64-bit type
-   [24]  64-bit type
-</pre>
-<p>As a counterexample, it's also clear that, whatever is at offset 32,
-it is not a 32-bit value.  That's because the last number of the group
-(37422) is not the same as the first three (18883 18883 18883).</p>
-<p>This example leads one to enquire (by reading the source code)
-whether the zeroes at 12--15 and 52--55 are alignment holes, and
-whether 48--51 is indeed a 32-bit type.  If so, it might be possible
-to place what's at 48--51 at 12--15 instead, which would reduce
-the object size from 56 to 48 bytes.</p>
-<p>Bear in mind that the above inferences are all only "maybes".  That's
-because they are based on dynamic data, not static analysis of the
-object layout.  For example, the zeroes might not be alignment
-holes, but rather just parts of the structure which were not used
-at all for this particular run.  Experience shows that's unlikely
-to be the case, but it could happen.</p>

-       allocation points according to some metric, and shows the
-       highest scoring entries.  <code class="varname">--show-top-n</code>
-       controls how many entries are shown.  The default of 10 is
-       quite small.  For realistic applications you will probably need
-       to set it much higher, at least several hundred.</p></dd>
-<dt>
-<a name="opt.sort-by"></a><span class="term">
-      <code class="option">--sort-by=&lt;string&gt; [default: max-bytes-live] </code>
-    </span>
-</dt>
-<dd>
-<p>At the end of the run, DHAT sorts the accumulated
-       allocation points according to some metric, and shows the
-       highest scoring entries.  <code class="varname">--sort-by</code>
-       selects the metric used for sorting:</p>
-<p><code class="varname">max-bytes-live   </code>    maximum live bytes [default]</p>
-<p><code class="varname">tot-bytes-allocd </code>  total allocation (turnover)</p>
-<p><code class="varname">max-blocks-live  </code>   maximum live blocks</p>
-<p>This controls the order in which allocation points are
-       displayed.  You can choose to look at allocation points with
-       the highest maximum liveness, or the highest total turnover, or
-       by the highest number of live blocks.  These give usefully
-       different pictures of program behaviour.  For example, sorting
-       by maximum live blocks tends to show up allocation points
-       creating large numbers of small objects.</p>
-</dd>
-</dl>
-</div>
-<p>One important point to note is that each allocation stack counts
-as a seperate allocation point.  Because stacks by default have 12
-frames, this tends to spread data out over multiple allocation points.
-You may want to use the flag --num-callers=4 or some such small
-number, to reduce the spreading.</p>

-<a name="drd-manual.mt-progr-models"></a>8.1.1.Multithreaded Programming Paradigms</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>
-There are two possible reasons for using multithreading in a program:
-</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      To model concurrent activities. Assigning one thread to each activity
-      can be a great simplification compared to multiplexing the states of
-      multiple activities in a single thread. This is why most server software
-      and embedded software is multithreaded.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      To use multiple CPU cores simultaneously for speeding up
-      computations. This is why many High Performance Computing (HPC)
-      applications are multithreaded.
-    </p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>
-</p>
-<p>
-Multithreaded programs can use one or more of the following programming
-paradigms. Which paradigm is appropriate depends e.g. on the application type.
-Some examples of multithreaded programming paradigms are:
-</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Locking. Data that is shared over threads is protected from concurrent
-      accesses via locking. E.g. the POSIX threads library, the Qt library
-      and the Boost.Thread library support this paradigm directly.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Message passing. No data is shared between threads, but threads exchange
-      data by passing messages to each other. Examples of implementations of
-      the message passing paradigm are MPI and CORBA.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Automatic parallelization. A compiler converts a sequential program into
-      a multithreaded program. The original program may or may not contain
-      parallelization hints. One example of such parallelization hints is the
-      OpenMP standard. In this standard a set of directives are defined which
-      tell a compiler how to parallelize a C, C++ or Fortran program. OpenMP
-      is well suited for computational intensive applications. As an example,
-      an open source image processing software package is using OpenMP to
-      maximize performance on systems with multiple CPU
-      cores. GCC supports the
-      OpenMP standard from version 4.2.0 on.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Software Transactional Memory (STM). Any data that is shared between
-      threads is updated via transactions. After each transaction it is
-      verified whether there were any conflicting transactions. If there were
-      conflicts, the transaction is aborted, otherwise it is committed. This
-      is a so-called optimistic approach. There is a prototype of the Intel C++
-      Compiler available that supports STM. Research about the addition of
-      STM support to GCC is ongoing.
-    </p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>
-</p>
-<p>
-DRD supports any combination of multithreaded programming paradigms as
-long as the implementation of these paradigms is based on the POSIX
-threads primitives. DRD however does not support programs that use
-e.g. Linux' futexes directly. Attempts to analyze such programs with
-DRD will cause DRD to report many false positives.

-<p>
-POSIX threads, also known as Pthreads, is the most widely available
-threading library on Unix systems.
-</p>
-<p>
-The POSIX threads programming model is based on the following abstractions:
-</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      A shared address space. All threads running within the same
-      process share the same address space. All data, whether shared or
-      not, is identified by its address.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Regular load and store operations, which allow to read values
-      from or to write values to the memory shared by all threads
-      running in the same process.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Atomic store and load-modify-store operations. While these are
-      not mentioned in the POSIX threads standard, most
-      microprocessors support atomic memory operations.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Threads. Each thread represents a concurrent activity.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Synchronization objects and operations on these synchronization
-      objects. The following types of synchronization objects have been
-      defined in the POSIX threads standard: mutexes, condition variables,
-      semaphores, reader-writer synchronization objects, barriers and
-      spinlocks.
-    </p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>
-</p>
-<p>
-Which source code statements generate which memory accesses depends on

-<p>
-Depending on which multithreading paradigm is being used in a program,
-one or more of the following problems can occur:
-</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Data races. One or more threads access the same memory location without
-      sufficient locking. Most but not all data races are programming errors
-      and are the cause of subtle and hard-to-find bugs.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Lock contention. One thread blocks the progress of one or more other
-      threads by holding a lock too long.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Improper use of the POSIX threads API. Most implementations of the POSIX
-      threads API have been optimized for runtime speed. Such implementations
-      will not complain on certain errors, e.g. when a mutex is being unlocked
-      by another thread than the thread that obtained a lock on the mutex.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Deadlock. A deadlock occurs when two or more threads wait for
-      each other indefinitely.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      False sharing. If threads that run on different processor cores
-      access different variables located in the same cache line
-      frequently, this will slow down the involved threads a lot due
-      to frequent exchange of cache lines.
-    </p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>
-</p>
-<p>
-Although the likelihood of the occurrence of data races can be reduced
-through a disciplined programming style, a tool for automatic
-detection of data races is a necessity when developing multithreaded
-software. DRD can detect these, as well as lock contention and
-improper use of the POSIX threads API.

-<p>
-The result of load and store operations performed by a multithreaded program
-depends on the order in which memory operations are performed. This order is
-determined by:
-</p>
-<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      All memory operations performed by the same thread are performed in
-      <span class="emphasis"><em>program order</em></span>, that is, the order determined by the
-      program source code and the results of previous load operations.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      Synchronization operations determine certain ordering constraints on
-      memory operations performed by different threads. These ordering
-      constraints are called the <span class="emphasis"><em>synchronization order</em></span>.
-    </p></li>
-</ol></div>
-<p>
-The combination of program order and synchronization order is called the
-<span class="emphasis"><em>happens-before relationship</em></span>. This concept was first
-defined by S. Adve et al in the paper <span class="emphasis"><em>Detecting data races on weak
-memory systems</em></span>, ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News, v.19 n.3,
-p.234-243, May 1991.
-</p>
-<p>
-Two memory operations <span class="emphasis"><em>conflict</em></span> if both operations are
-performed by different threads, refer to the same memory location and at least
-one of them is a store operation.
-</p>
-<p>
-A multithreaded program is <span class="emphasis"><em>data-race free</em></span> if all
-conflicting memory accesses are ordered by synchronization
-operations.
-</p>
-<p>
-A well known way to ensure that a multithreaded program is data-race
-free is to ensure that a locking discipline is followed. It is e.g.
-possible to associate a mutex with each shared data item, and to hold
-a lock on the associated mutex while the shared data is accessed.
-</p>
-<p>
-All programs that follow a locking discipline are data-race free, but not all
-data-race free programs follow a locking discipline. There exist multithreaded
-programs where access to shared data is arbitrated via condition variables,
-semaphores or barriers. As an example, a certain class of HPC applications
-consists of a sequence of computation steps separated in time by barriers, and
-where these barriers are the only means of synchronization. Although there are
-many conflicting memory accesses in such applications and although such
-applications do not make use mutexes, most of these applications do not
-contain data races.
-</p>
-<p>
-There exist two different approaches for verifying the correctness of
-multithreaded programs at runtime. The approach of the so-called Eraser
-algorithm is to verify whether all shared memory accesses follow a consistent
-locking strategy. And the happens-before data race detectors verify directly
-whether all interthread memory accesses are ordered by synchronization
-operations. While the last approach is more complex to implement, and while it
-is more sensitive to OS scheduling, it is a general approach that works for
-all classes of multithreaded programs. An important advantage of
-happens-before data race detectors is that these do not report any false
-positives.
-</p>
-<p>
-DRD is based on the happens-before algorithm.

-      The term <span class="emphasis"><em>segment</em></span> refers to a consecutive

-      synchronization operation. Data race analysis is performed
-      between segments instead of between individual load and store
-      operations because of performance reasons.

-Threads must be able to make progress without being blocked for too long by
-other threads. Sometimes a thread has to wait until a mutex or reader-writer
-synchronization object is unlocked by another thread. This is called
-<span class="emphasis"><em>lock contention</em></span>.
-</p>
-<p>
-Lock contention causes delays. Such delays should be as short as
-possible. The two command line options
-<code class="literal">--exclusive-threshold=&lt;n&gt;</code> and
-<code class="literal">--shared-threshold=&lt;n&gt;</code> make it possible to
-detect excessive lock contention by making DRD report any lock that
-has been held longer than the specified threshold. An example:
-</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">

-Just as for other Valgrind tools it is possible to let a client program
-interact with the DRD tool through client requests. In addition to the
-client requests several macros have been defined that allow to use the
-client requests in a convenient way.
-</p>
-<p>
-The interface between client programs and the DRD tool is defined in
-the header file <code class="literal">&lt;valgrind/drd.h&gt;</code>. The
-available macros and client requests are:

-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      The macro <code class="literal">DRD_GET_VALGRIND_THREADID</code> and the

-      request <code class="varname">VG_USERREQ__DRD_GET_VALGRIND_THREAD_ID</code>.
-      Query the thread ID that has been assigned by the Valgrind core to the
-      thread executing this client request. Valgrind's thread ID's start at
-      one and are recycled in case a thread stops.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      The macro <code class="literal">DRD_GET_DRD_THREADID</code> and the corresponding
-      client request <code class="varname">VG_USERREQ__DRD_GET_DRD_THREAD_ID</code>.
-      Query the thread ID that has been assigned by DRD to the thread
-      executing this client request. These are the thread ID's reported by DRD
-      in data race reports and in trace messages. DRD's thread ID's start at
-      one and are never recycled.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      The macros <code class="literal">DRD_IGNORE_VAR(x)</code>,
-      <code class="literal">ANNOTATE_TRACE_MEMORY(&amp;x)</code> and the corresponding
-      client request <code class="varname">VG_USERREQ__DRD_START_SUPPRESSION</code>. Some
-      applications contain intentional races. There exist e.g. applications
-      where the same value is assigned to a shared variable from two different
-      threads. It may be more convenient to suppress such races than to solve
-      these. This client request allows to suppress such races.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      The macro <code class="literal">DRD_STOP_IGNORING_VAR(x)</code> and the
-      corresponding client request
-      <code class="varname">VG_USERREQ__DRD_FINISH_SUPPRESSION</code>. Tell DRD

-<p>
-OpenMP stands for <span class="emphasis"><em>Open Multi-Processing</em></span>. The OpenMP
-standard consists of a set of compiler directives for C, C++ and Fortran
-programs that allows a compiler to transform a sequential program into a
-parallel program. OpenMP is well suited for HPC applications and allows to
-work at a higher level compared to direct use of the POSIX threads API. While
-OpenMP ensures that the POSIX API is used correctly, OpenMP programs can still
-contain data races. So it definitely makes sense to verify OpenMP programs
-with a thread checking tool.
-</p>
-<p>
-DRD supports OpenMP shared-memory programs generated by GCC. GCC
-supports OpenMP since version 4.2.0.  GCC's runtime support
-for OpenMP programs is provided by a library called
-<code class="literal">libgomp</code>. The synchronization primitives implemented
-in this library use Linux' futex system call directly, unless the
-library has been configured with the
-<code class="literal">--disable-linux-futex</code> option. DRD only supports
-libgomp libraries that have been configured with this option and in
-which symbol information is present. For most Linux distributions this
-means that you will have to recompile GCC. See also the script
-<code class="literal">drd/scripts/download-and-build-gcc</code> in the
-Valgrind source tree for an example of how to compile GCC. You will
-also have to make sure that the newly compiled
-<code class="literal">libgomp.so</code> library is loaded when OpenMP programs
-are started. This is possible by adding a line similar to the
-following to your shell startup script:
-</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/gcc-4.4.0/lib64:~/gcc-4.4.0/lib:
-</pre>
-<p>
-As an example, the test OpenMP test program
-<code class="literal">drd/tests/omp_matinv</code> triggers a data race
-when the option -r has been specified on the command line. The data
-race is triggered by the following code:
-</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-#pragma omp parallel for private(j)
-for (j = 0; j &lt; rows; j++)
-{
-  if (i != j)
-  {
-    const elem_t factor = a[j * cols + i];
-    for (k = 0; k &lt; cols; k++)
-    {
-      a[j * cols + k] -= a[i * cols + k] * factor;
-    }
-  }
-}
-</pre>
-<p>
-The above code is racy because the variable <code class="literal">k</code> has
-not been declared private. DRD will print the following error message
-for the above code:
-</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-$ valgrind --tool=drd --check-stack-var=yes --read-var-info=yes drd/tests/omp_matinv 3 -t 2 -r

-<p>
-In the above output the function name <code class="function">gj.omp_fn.0</code>
-has been generated by GCC from the function name
-<code class="function">gj</code>. The allocation context information shows that the
-data race has been caused by modifying the variable <code class="literal">k</code>.
-</p>
-<p>
-Note: for GCC versions before 4.4.0, no allocation context information is
-shown. With these GCC versions the most usable information in the above output
-is the source file name and the line number where the data race has been
-detected (<code class="literal">omp_matinv.c:203</code>).

-<a name="drd-manual.cust-mem-alloc"></a>8.2.9.DRD and Custom Memory Allocators</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>
-DRD tracks all memory allocation events that happen via the
-standard memory allocation and deallocation functions
-(<code class="function">malloc</code>, <code class="function">free</code>,
-<code class="function">new</code> and <code class="function">delete</code>), via entry
-and exit of stack frames or that have been annotated with Valgrind's
-memory pool client requests. DRD uses memory allocation and deallocation
-information for two purposes:
-</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      To know where the scope ends of POSIX objects that have not been
-      destroyed explicitly. It is e.g. not required by the POSIX
-      threads standard to call
-      <code class="function">pthread_mutex_destroy</code> before freeing the
-      memory in which a mutex object resides.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      To know where the scope of variables ends. If e.g. heap memory
-      has been used by one thread, that thread frees that memory, and
-      another thread allocates and starts using that memory, no data
-      races must be reported for that memory.
-    </p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>
-</p>
-<p>
-It is essential for correct operation of DRD that the tool knows about
-memory allocation and deallocation events. When analyzing a client program
-with DRD that uses a custom memory allocator, either instrument the custom
-memory allocator with the <code class="literal">VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK</code>
-and <code class="literal">VALGRIND_FREELIKE_BLOCK</code> macros or disable the
-custom memory allocator.
-</p>
-<p>
-As an example, the GNU libstdc++ library can be configured
-to use standard memory allocation functions instead of memory pools by
-setting the environment variable
-<code class="literal">GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW</code>. For more information, see also
-the <a class="ulink" href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/bk01pt04ch11.html" target="_top">libstdc++

-<p>
-It is essential for correct operation of DRD that there are no memory
-errors such as dangling pointers in the client program. Which means that
-it is a good idea to make sure that your program is Memcheck-clean
-before you analyze it with DRD. It is possible however that some of
-the Memcheck reports are caused by data races. In this case it makes
-sense to run DRD before Memcheck.
-</p>
-<p>
-So which tool should be run first? In case both DRD and Memcheck
-complain about a program, a possible approach is to run both tools
-alternatingly and to fix as many errors as possible after each run of
-each tool until none of the two tools prints any more error messages.

-</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      When running a program under DRD with default DRD options,
-      between 1.1 and 3.6 times more memory will be needed compared to

-      if loading debug information has been enabled
-      (<code class="literal">--read-var-info=yes</code>).
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>
-      DRD allocates some of its temporary data structures on the stack

-    </p></li>

-<p>From Nordic mythology.  Originally (before release) the project
-  was named Heimdall, after the watchman of the Nordic gods.  He could
-  "see a hundred miles by day or night, hear the grass growing, see the
-  wool growing on a sheep's back", etc.  This would have been a great
-  name, but it was already taken by a security package "Heimdal".</p>
-<p>Keeping with the Nordic theme, Valgrind was chosen.  Valgrind is
-  the name of the main entrance to Valhalla (the Hall of the Chosen
-  Slain in Asgard).  Over this entrance there resides a wolf and over it
-  there is the head of a boar and on it perches a huge eagle, whose eyes
-  can see to the far regions of the nine worlds.  Only those judged
-  worthy by the guardians are allowed to pass through Valgrind.  All
-  others are refused entrance.</p>

-<p>One possibility is that your program has a bug and erroneously

-    Memcheck may issue a warning just before this happens, but it might not
-    if the jump happens to land in addressable memory.</p>
-<p>Another possibility is that Valgrind does not handle the

-    handle the instruction.  However, all instruction sets have some
-    obscure, rarely used instructions.  Also, on amd64 there are an almost

-<p>First of all: relax, it's probably not a bug, but a feature.
-    Many implementations of the C++ standard libraries use their own
-    memory pool allocators.  Memory for quite a number of destructed
-    objects is not immediately freed and given back to the OS, but kept
-    in the pool(s) for later re-use.  The fact that the pools are not
-    freed at the exit of the program cause Valgrind to report this
-    memory as still reachable.  The behaviour not to free pools at the
-    exit could be called a bug of the library though.</p>
-<p>Using GCC, you can force the STL to use malloc and to free
-    memory as soon as possible by globally disabling memory caching.
-    Beware!  Doing so will probably slow down your program, sometimes
-    drastically.</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>With GCC 2.91, 2.95, 3.0 and 3.1, compile all source using
-        the STL with <code class="literal">-D__USE_MALLOC</code>. Beware!  This was
-        removed from GCC starting with version 3.3.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>With GCC 3.2.2 and later, you should export the
-        environment variable <code class="literal">GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW</code> before
-        running your program.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>With GCC 3.4 and later, that variable has changed name to
-        <code class="literal">GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW</code>.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>There are other ways to disable memory pooling: using the
-    <code class="literal">malloc_alloc</code> template with your objects (not
-    portable, but should work for GCC) or even writing your own memory
-    allocators. But all this goes beyond the scope of this FAQ.  Start
-    by reading 
-    <a class="ulink" href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/faq/index.html#4_4_leak" target="_top">
-         http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/faq/index.html#4_4_leak</a>
-    if you absolutely want to do that. But beware: 
-    allocators belong to the more messy parts of the STL and
-    people went to great lengths to make the STL portable across
-    platforms. Chances are good that your solution will work on your
-    platform, but not on others.</p>

-<p>When a program runs under Valgrind, its environment is slightly
-    different to when it runs natively.  For example, the memory layout is
-    different, and the way that threads are scheduled is different.</p>
-<p>Most of the time this doesn't make any difference, but it can,
-    particularly if your program is buggy.  For example, if your program
-    crashes because it erroneously accesses memory that is unaddressable,
-    it's possible that this memory will not be unaddressable when run under
-    Valgrind.  Alternatively, if your program has data races, these may not
-    manifest under Valgrind.</p>
-<p>There isn't anything you can do to change this, it's just the
-    nature of the way Valgrind works that it cannot exactly replicate a
-    native execution environment.  In the case where your program crashes
-    due to a memory error when run natively but not when run under Valgrind,
-    in most cases Memcheck should identify the bad memory operation.</p>

-<p>There are two possible causes of this.</p>
-<p>First, by default, Valgrind only traces the top-level process.
-    So if your program spawns children, they won't be traced by Valgrind
-    by default.  Also, if your program is started by a shell script,
-    Perl script, or something similar, Valgrind will trace the shell, or
-    the Perl interpreter, or equivalent.</p>
-<p>To trace child processes, use the
-    <code class="option">--trace-children=yes</code> option.</p>
-<p>If you are tracing large trees of processes, it can be less
-    disruptive to have the output sent over the network.  Give Valgrind
-    the option <code class="option">--log-socket=127.0.0.1:12345</code> (if you want
-    logging output sent to port <code class="literal">12345</code> on
-    <code class="literal">localhost</code>).  You can use the valgrind-listener
-    program to listen on that port:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-valgrind-listener 12345
-</pre>
-<p>Obviously you have to start the listener process first.  See
-    the manual for more details.</p>
-<p>Second, if your program is statically linked, most Valgrind
-    tools won't work as well, because they won't be able to replace
-    certain functions, such as <code class="function">malloc</code>, with their own
-    versions.  A key indicator of this is if Memcheck says:
-</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
-</pre>
-<p>
-    when you know your program calls <code class="function">malloc</code>.  The
-    workaround is to avoid statically linking your program.</p>

-<p>Helgrind is a Valgrind tool for detecting synchronisation errors
-in C, C++ and Fortran programs that use the POSIX pthreads
-threading primitives.</p>
-<p>The main abstractions in POSIX pthreads are: a set of threads
-sharing a common address space, thread creation, thread joining,
-thread exit, mutexes (locks), condition variables (inter-thread event
-notifications), reader-writer locks, spinlocks, semaphores and
-barriers.</p>
-<p>Helgrind can detect three classes of errors, which are discussed
-in detail in the next three sections:</p>
-<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
-<li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="hg-manual.html#hg-manual.api-checks" title="7.2.Detected errors: Misuses of the POSIX pthreads API">

-<li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="hg-manual.html#hg-manual.lock-orders" title="7.3.Detected errors: Inconsistent Lock Orderings">
-        Potential deadlocks arising from lock
-        ordering problems.</a></p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="hg-manual.html#hg-manual.data-races" title="7.4.Detected errors: Data Races">
-        Data races -- accessing memory without adequate locking
-                      or synchronisation</a>.
-  </p></li>
-</ol></div>
-<p>Problems like these often result in unreproducible,
-timing-dependent crashes, deadlocks and other misbehaviour, and
-can be difficult to find by other means.</p>
-<p>Helgrind is aware of all the pthread abstractions and tracks
-their effects as accurately as it can.  On x86 and amd64 platforms, it
-understands and partially handles implicit locking arising from the
-use of the LOCK instruction prefix.  On PowerPC/POWER and ARM
-platforms, it partially handles implicit locking arising from 
-load-linked and store-conditional instruction pairs.
-</p>
-<p>Helgrind works best when your application uses only the POSIX
-pthreads API.  However, if you want to use custom threading 
-primitives, you can describe their behaviour to Helgrind using the
-<code class="varname">ANNOTATE_*</code> macros defined
-in <code class="varname">helgrind.h</code>.</p>

-<p>Helgrind intercepts calls to many POSIX pthreads functions, and
-is therefore able to report on various common problems.  Although
-these are unglamourous errors, their presence can lead to undefined
-program behaviour and hard-to-find bugs later on.  The detected errors
-are:</p>

-at</code>" part), so you have a chance of figuring out which
-mutex it is referring to.  For example:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-Thread #1 unlocked a not-locked lock at 0x7FEFFFA90
-   at 0x4C2408D: pthread_mutex_unlock (hg_intercepts.c:492)

-   by 0x40079B: main (tc09_bad_unlock.c:50)
-  Lock at 0x7FEFFFA90 was first observed
-   at 0x4C25D01: pthread_mutex_init (hg_intercepts.c:326)
-   by 0x40071F: nearly_main (tc09_bad_unlock.c:23)

-<p>Helgrind has a way of summarising thread identities, as
-you see here with the text "<code class="computeroutput">Thread
-#1</code>".  This is so that it can speak about threads and
-sets of threads without overwhelming you with details.  See 
-<a class="link" href="hg-manual.html#hg-manual.data-races.errmsgs" title="7.4.3.Interpreting Race Error Messages">below</a>

-<p>In this section, and in general, to "acquire" a lock simply
-means to lock that lock, and to "release" a lock means to unlock
-it.</p>
-<p>Helgrind monitors the order in which threads acquire locks.
-This allows it to detect potential deadlocks which could arise from
-the formation of cycles of locks.  Detecting such inconsistencies is
-useful because, whilst actual deadlocks are fairly obvious, potential
-deadlocks may never be discovered during testing and could later lead
-to hard-to-diagnose in-service failures.</p>
-<p>The simplest example of such a problem is as
-follows.</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>Imagine some shared resource R, which, for whatever
-  reason, is guarded by two locks, L1 and L2, which must both be held
-  when R is accessed.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Suppose a thread acquires L1, then L2, and proceeds
-  to access R.  The implication of this is that all threads in the
-  program must acquire the two locks in the order first L1 then L2.
-  Not doing so risks deadlock.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>The deadlock could happen if two threads -- call them
-  T1 and T2 -- both want to access R.  Suppose T1 acquires L1 first,
-  and T2 acquires L2 first.  Then T1 tries to acquire L2, and T2 tries
-  to acquire L1, but those locks are both already held.  So T1 and T2
-  become deadlocked.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>Helgrind builds a directed graph indicating the order in which
-locks have been acquired in the past.  When a thread acquires a new
-lock, the graph is updated, and then checked to see if it now contains
-a cycle.  The presence of a cycle indicates a potential deadlock involving
-the locks in the cycle.</p>
-<p>In general, Helgrind will choose two locks involved in the cycle
-and show you how their acquisition ordering has become inconsistent.
-It does this by showing the program points that first defined the
-ordering, and the program points which later violated it.  Here is a
-simple example involving just two locks:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-Thread #1: lock order "0x7FF0006D0 before 0x7FF0006A0" violated
-
-Observed (incorrect) order is: acquisition of lock at 0x7FF0006A0
-   at 0x4C2BC62: pthread_mutex_lock (hg_intercepts.c:494)
-   by 0x400825: main (tc13_laog1.c:23)
-
- followed by a later acquisition of lock at 0x7FF0006D0
-   at 0x4C2BC62: pthread_mutex_lock (hg_intercepts.c:494)
-   by 0x400853: main (tc13_laog1.c:24)
-
-Required order was established by acquisition of lock at 0x7FF0006D0
-   at 0x4C2BC62: pthread_mutex_lock (hg_intercepts.c:494)
-   by 0x40076D: main (tc13_laog1.c:17)

- followed by a later acquisition of lock at 0x7FF0006A0
-   at 0x4C2BC62: pthread_mutex_lock (hg_intercepts.c:494)
-   by 0x40079B: main (tc13_laog1.c:18)
-</pre>
-<p>When there are more than two locks in the cycle, the error is
-equally serious.  However, at present Helgrind does not show the locks
-involved, sometimes because it that information is not available, but
-also so as to avoid flooding you with information.  For example, here
-is an example involving a cycle of five locks from a naive
-implementation the famous Dining Philosophers problem
-(see <code class="computeroutput">helgrind/tests/tc14_laog_dinphils.c</code>).
-In this case Helgrind has detected that all 5 philosophers could
-simultaneously pick up their left fork and then deadlock whilst
-waiting to pick up their right forks.</p>

-<p>A data race happens, or could happen, when two threads access a
-shared memory location without using suitable locks or other
-synchronisation to ensure single-threaded access.  Such missing
-locking can cause obscure timing dependent bugs.  Ensuring programs
-are race-free is one of the central difficulties of threaded
-programming.</p>
-<p>Reliably detecting races is a difficult problem, and most
-of Helgrind's internals are devoted to dealing with it.  
-We begin with a simple example.</p>
-<div class="sect2" title="7.4.1.A Simple Data Race">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="hg-manual.data-races.example"></a>7.4.1.A Simple Data Race</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>About the simplest possible example of a race is as follows.  In
-this program, it is impossible to know what the value
-of <code class="computeroutput">var</code> is at the end of the program.
-Is it 2 ?  Or 1 ?</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
-
-int var = 0;
-
-void* child_fn ( void* arg ) {
-   var++; /* Unprotected relative to parent */ /* this is line 6 */
-   return NULL;
-}
-
-int main ( void ) {
-   pthread_t child;
-   pthread_create(&amp;child, NULL, child_fn, NULL);
-   var++; /* Unprotected relative to child */ /* this is line 13 */
-   pthread_join(child, NULL);
-   return 0;
-}
-</pre>
-<p>The problem is there is nothing to
-stop <code class="varname">var</code> being updated simultaneously
-by both threads.  A correct program would 
-protect <code class="varname">var</code> with a lock of type
-<code class="function">pthread_mutex_t</code>, which is acquired
-before each access and released afterwards.  Helgrind's output for
-this program is:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">

-</pre>
-<p>This is quite a lot of detail for an apparently simple error.
-The last clause is the main error message.  It says there is a race as
-a result of a read of size 4 (bytes), at 0x601038, which is the
-address of <code class="computeroutput">var</code>, happening in
-function <code class="computeroutput">main</code> at line 13 in the
-program.</p>
-<p>Two important parts of the message are:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Helgrind shows two stack traces for the error, not one.  By
-   definition, a race involves two different threads accessing the
-   same location in such a way that the result depends on the relative
-   speeds of the two threads.</p>
-<p>
-   The first stack trace follows the text "<code class="computeroutput">Possible
-   data race during read of size 4 ...</code>" and the
-   second trace follows the text "<code class="computeroutput">This conflicts with
-   a previous write of size 4 ...</code>".  Helgrind is
-   usually able to show both accesses involved in a race.  At least
-   one of these will be a write (since two concurrent, unsynchronised
-   reads are harmless), and they will of course be from different
-   threads.</p>
-<p>By examining your program at the two locations, you should be
-   able to get at least some idea of what the root cause of the
-   problem is.  For each location, Helgrind shows the set of locks
-   held at the time of the access.  This often makes it clear which
-   thread, if any, failed to take a required lock.  In this example
-   neither thread holds a lock during the access.</p>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>For races which occur on global or stack variables, Helgrind
-   tries to identify the name and defining point of the variable.
-   Hence the text "<code class="computeroutput">Location 0x601038 is 0 bytes inside
-   global var "var" declared at simple_race.c:3</code>".</p>
-<p>Showing names of stack and global variables carries no
-   run-time overhead once Helgrind has your program up and running.
-   However, it does require Helgrind to spend considerable extra time
-   and memory at program startup to read the relevant debug info.
-   Hence this facility is disabled by default.  To enable it, you need
-   to give the <code class="varname">--read-var-info=yes</code> option to

-<p>Most programmers think about threaded programming in terms of
-the basic functionality provided by the threading library (POSIX
-Pthreads): thread creation, thread joining, locks, condition
-variables, semaphores and barriers.</p>
-<p>The effect of using these functions is to impose 
-constraints upon the order in which memory accesses can
-happen.  This implied ordering is generally known as the
-"happens-before relation".  Once you understand the happens-before
-relation, it is easy to see how Helgrind finds races in your code.
-Fortunately, the happens-before relation is itself easy to understand,
-and is by itself a useful tool for reasoning about the behaviour of
-parallel programs.  We now introduce it using a simple example.</p>
-<p>Consider first the following buggy program:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-Parent thread:                         Child thread:
-
-int var;
-
-// create child thread
-pthread_create(...)                          
-var = 20;                              var = 10;
-                                       exit
-
-// wait for child
-pthread_join(...)
-printf("%d\n", var);
-</pre>
-<p>The parent thread creates a child.  Both then write different
-values to some variable <code class="computeroutput">var</code>, and the
-parent then waits for the child to exit.</p>
-<p>What is the value of <code class="computeroutput">var</code> at the
-end of the program, 10 or 20?  We don't know.  The program is
-considered buggy (it has a race) because the final value
-of <code class="computeroutput">var</code> depends on the relative rates
-of progress of the parent and child threads.  If the parent is fast
-and the child is slow, then the child's assignment may happen later,
-so the final value will be 10; and vice versa if the child is faster
-than the parent.</p>
-<p>The relative rates of progress of parent vs child is not something
-the programmer can control, and will often change from run to run.
-It depends on factors such as the load on the machine, what else is
-running, the kernel's scheduling strategy, and many other factors.</p>
-<p>The obvious fix is to use a lock to
-protect <code class="computeroutput">var</code>.  It is however
-instructive to consider a somewhat more abstract solution, which is to
-send a message from one thread to the other:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-Parent thread:                         Child thread:
-
-int var;
-
-// create child thread
-pthread_create(...)                          
-var = 20;
-// send message to child
-                                       // wait for message to arrive
-                                       var = 10;
-                                       exit
-
-// wait for child
-pthread_join(...)
-printf("%d\n", var);
-</pre>
-<p>Now the program reliably prints "10", regardless of the speed of
-the threads.  Why?  Because the child's assignment cannot happen until
-after it receives the message.  And the message is not sent until
-after the parent's assignment is done.</p>
-<p>The message transmission creates a "happens-before" dependency
-between the two assignments: <code class="computeroutput">var = 20;</code>
-must now happen-before <code class="computeroutput">var = 10;</code>.
-And so there is no longer a race
-on <code class="computeroutput">var</code>.
-</p>
-<p>Note that it's not significant that the parent sends a message
-to the child.  Sending a message from the child (after its assignment)
-to the parent (before its assignment) would also fix the problem, causing
-the program to reliably print "20".</p>
-<p>Helgrind's algorithm is (conceptually) very simple.  It monitors all
-accesses to memory locations.  If a location -- in this example, 
-<code class="computeroutput">var</code>,
-is accessed by two different threads, Helgrind checks to see if the
-two accesses are ordered by the happens-before relation.  If so,
-that's fine; if not, it reports a race.</p>
-<p>It is important to understand that the happens-before relation
-creates only a partial ordering, not a total ordering.  An example of
-a total ordering is comparison of numbers: for any two numbers 
-<code class="computeroutput">x</code> and
-<code class="computeroutput">y</code>, either 
-<code class="computeroutput">x</code> is less than, equal to, or greater
-than
-<code class="computeroutput">y</code>.  A partial ordering is like a
-total ordering, but it can also express the concept that two elements
-are neither equal, less or greater, but merely unordered with respect
-to each other.</p>
-<p>In the fixed example above, we say that 
-<code class="computeroutput">var = 20;</code> "happens-before"
-<code class="computeroutput">var = 10;</code>.  But in the original
-version, they are unordered: we cannot say that either happens-before
-the other.</p>
-<p>What does it mean to say that two accesses from different
-threads are ordered by the happens-before relation?  It means that
-there is some chain of inter-thread synchronisation operations which
-cause those accesses to happen in a particular order, irrespective of
-the actual rates of progress of the individual threads.  This is a
-required property for a reliable threaded program, which is why
-Helgrind checks for it.</p>
-<p>The happens-before relations created by standard threading
-primitives are as follows:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>When a mutex is unlocked by thread T1 and later (or
-  immediately) locked by thread T2, then the memory accesses in T1
-  prior to the unlock must happen-before those in T2 after it acquires
-  the lock.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>The same idea applies to reader-writer locks,
-  although with some complication so as to allow correct handling of
-  reads vs writes.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>When a condition variable (CV) is signalled on by
-  thread T1 and some other thread T2 is thereby released from a wait
-  on the same CV, then the memory accesses in T1 prior to the
-  signalling must happen-before those in T2 after it returns from the
-  wait.  If no thread was waiting on the CV then there is no
-  effect.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>If instead T1 broadcasts on a CV, then all of the
-  waiting threads, rather than just one of them, acquire a
-  happens-before dependency on the broadcasting thread at the point it
-  did the broadcast.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>A thread T2 that continues after completing sem_wait
-  on a semaphore that thread T1 posts on, acquires a happens-before
-  dependence on the posting thread, a bit like dependencies caused
-  mutex unlock-lock pairs.  However, since a semaphore can be posted
-  on many times, it is unspecified from which of the post calls the
-  wait call gets its happens-before dependency.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>For a group of threads T1 .. Tn which arrive at a
-  barrier and then move on, each thread after the call has a
-  happens-after dependency from all threads before the
-  barrier.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>A newly-created child thread acquires an initial
-  happens-after dependency on the point where its parent created it.
-  That is, all memory accesses performed by the parent prior to
-  creating the child are regarded as happening-before all the accesses
-  of the child.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Similarly, when an exiting thread is reaped via a
-  call to <code class="function">pthread_join</code>, once the call returns, the
-  reaping thread acquires a happens-after dependency relative to all memory
-  accesses made by the exiting thread.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>In summary: Helgrind intercepts the above listed events, and builds a
-directed acyclic graph represented the collective happens-before
-dependencies.  It also monitors all memory accesses.</p>
-<p>If a location is accessed by two different threads, but Helgrind
-cannot find any path through the happens-before graph from one access
-to the other, then it reports a race.</p>
-<p>There are a couple of caveats:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>Helgrind doesn't check for a race in the case where
-  both accesses are reads.  That would be silly, since concurrent
-  reads are harmless.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Two accesses are considered to be ordered by the
-  happens-before dependency even through arbitrarily long chains of
-  synchronisation events.  For example, if T1 accesses some location
-  L, and then <code class="function">pthread_cond_signals</code> T2, which later
-  <code class="function">pthread_cond_signals</code> T3, which then accesses L, then
-  a suitable happens-before dependency exists between the first and second
-  accesses, even though it involves two different inter-thread
-  synchronisation events.</p></li>

-</pre>
-<p>Helgrind first announces the creation points of any threads
-referenced in the error message.  This is so it can speak concisely
-about threads without repeatedly printing their creation point call
-stacks.  Each thread is only ever announced once, the first time it
-appears in any Helgrind error message.</p>
-<p>The main error message begins at the text
-"<code class="computeroutput">Possible data race during read</code>".  At
-the start is information you would expect to see -- address and size
-of the racing access, whether a read or a write, and the call stack at
-the point it was detected.</p>
-<p>A second call stack is presented starting at the text
-"<code class="computeroutput">This conflicts with a previous
-write</code>".  This shows a previous access which also
-accessed the stated address, and which is believed to be racing
-against the access in the first call stack. Note that this second
-call stack is limited to a maximum of 8 entries to limit the
-memory usage.</p>
-<p>Finally, Helgrind may attempt to give a description of the
-raced-on address in source level terms.  In this example, it
-identifies it as a local variable, shows its name, declaration point,
-and in which frame (of the first call stack) it lives.  Note that this
-information is only shown when <code class="varname">--read-var-info=yes</code>
-is specified on the command line.  That's because reading the DWARF3
-debug information in enough detail to capture variable type and
-location information makes Helgrind much slower at startup, and also
-requires considerable amounts of memory, for large programs.
-</p>
-<p>Once you have your two call stacks, how do you find the root
-cause of the race?</p>
-<p>The first thing to do is examine the source locations referred
-to by each call stack.  They should both show an access to the same
-location, or variable.</p>
-<p>Now figure out how how that location should have been made
-thread-safe:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>Perhaps the location was intended to be protected by
-  a mutex?  If so, you need to lock and unlock the mutex at both
-  access points, even if one of the accesses is reported to be a read.
-  Did you perhaps forget the locking at one or other of the accesses?
-  To help you do this, Helgrind shows the set of locks held by each
-  threads at the time they accessed the raced-on location.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Alternatively, perhaps you intended to use a some
-  other scheme to make it safe, such as signalling on a condition
-  variable.  In all such cases, try to find a synchronisation event
-  (or a chain thereof) which separates the earlier-observed access (as
-  shown in the second call stack) from the later-observed access (as
-  shown in the first call stack).  In other words, try to find
-  evidence that the earlier access "happens-before" the later access.
-  See the previous subsection for an explanation of the happens-before
-  relation.</p>
-<p>
-  The fact that Helgrind is reporting a race means it did not observe
-  any happens-before relation between the two accesses.  If
-  Helgrind is working correctly, it should also be the case that you
-  also cannot find any such relation, even on detailed inspection
-  of the source code.  Hopefully, though, your inspection of the code
-  will show where the missing synchronisation operation(s) should have
-  been.</p>

-<p>Helgrind can be very helpful in finding and resolving
-threading-related problems.  Like all sophisticated tools, it is most
-effective when you understand how to play to its strengths.</p>
-<p>Helgrind will be less effective when you merely throw an
-existing threaded program at it and try to make sense of any reported
-errors.  It will be more effective if you design threaded programs
-from the start in a way that helps Helgrind verify correctness.  The
-same is true for finding memory errors with Memcheck, but applies more
-here, because thread checking is a harder problem.  Consequently it is
-much easier to write a correct program for which Helgrind falsely
-reports (threading) errors than it is to write a correct program for
-which Memcheck falsely reports (memory) errors.</p>
-<p>With that in mind, here are some tips, listed most important first,
-for getting reliable results and avoiding false errors.  The first two
-are critical.  Any violations of them will swamp you with huge numbers
-of false data-race errors.</p>
-<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Make sure your application, and all the libraries it uses,
-    use the POSIX threading primitives.  Helgrind needs to be able to
-    see all events pertaining to thread creation, exit, locking and
-    other synchronisation events.  To do so it intercepts many POSIX
-    pthreads functions.</p>
-<p>Do not roll your own threading primitives (mutexes, etc)
-    from combinations of the Linux futex syscall, atomic counters, etc.
-    These throw Helgrind's internal what's-going-on models
-    way off course and will give bogus results.</p>
-<p>Also, do not reimplement existing POSIX abstractions using
-    other POSIX abstractions.  For example, don't build your own
-    semaphore routines or reader-writer locks from POSIX mutexes and
-    condition variables.  Instead use POSIX reader-writer locks and
-    semaphores directly, since Helgrind supports them directly.</p>
-<p>Helgrind directly supports the following POSIX threading
-    abstractions: mutexes, reader-writer locks, condition variables
-    (but see below), semaphores and barriers.  Currently spinlocks
-    are not supported, although they could be in future.</p>
-<p>At the time of writing, the following popular Linux packages
-    are known to implement their own threading primitives:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>Qt version 4.X.  Qt 3.X is harmless in that it
-      only uses POSIX pthreads primitives.  Unfortunately Qt 4.X 
-      has its own implementation of mutexes (QMutex) and thread reaping.
-      Helgrind 3.4.x contains direct support
-      for Qt 4.X threading, which is experimental but is believed to
-      work fairly well.  A side effect of supporting Qt 4 directly is
-      that Helgrind can be used to debug KDE4 applications.  As this
-      is an experimental feature, we would particularly appreciate
-      feedback from folks who have used Helgrind to successfully debug
-      Qt 4 and/or KDE4 applications.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Runtime support library for GNU OpenMP (part of
-      GCC), at least for GCC versions 4.2 and 4.3.  The GNU OpenMP runtime
-      library (<code class="filename">libgomp.so</code>) constructs its own
-      synchronisation primitives using combinations of atomic memory
-      instructions and the futex syscall, which causes total chaos since in
-      Helgrind since it cannot "see" those.</p>
-<p>Fortunately, this can be solved using a configuration-time
-      option (for GCC).  Rebuild GCC from source, and configure using
-      <code class="varname">--disable-linux-futex</code>.
-      This makes libgomp.so use the standard
-      POSIX threading primitives instead.  Note that this was tested
-      using GCC 4.2.3 and has not been re-tested using more recent GCC
-      versions.  We would appreciate hearing about any successes or
-      failures with more recent versions.</p>
-</li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>If you must implement your own threading primitives, there
-      are a set of client request macros
-      in <code class="computeroutput">helgrind.h</code> to help you
-      describe your primitives to Helgrind.  You should be able to
-      mark up mutexes, condition variables, etc, without difficulty.
-    </p>
-<p>
-      It is also possible to mark up the effects of thread-safe
-      reference counting using the
-      <code class="computeroutput">ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE</code>,
-      <code class="computeroutput">ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER</code> and
-      <code class="computeroutput">ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE_FORGET_ALL</code>,
-      macros.  Thread-safe reference counting using an atomically
-      incremented/decremented refcount variable causes Helgrind
-      problems because a one-to-zero transition of the reference count
-      means the accessing thread has exclusive ownership of the
-      associated resource (normally, a C++ object) and can therefore
-      access it (normally, to run its destructor) without locking.
-      Helgrind doesn't understand this, and markup is essential to
-      avoid false positives.
-    </p>
-<p>
-      Here are recommended guidelines for marking up thread safe
-      reference counting in C++.  You only need to mark up your
-      release methods -- the ones which decrement the reference count.
-      Given a class like this:
-    </p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-class MyClass {
-   unsigned int mRefCount;
-
-   void Release ( void ) {
-      unsigned int newCount = atomic_decrement(&amp;mRefCount);
-      if (newCount == 0) {
-         delete this;
-      }
-   }
-}
-</pre>
-<p>
-     the release method should be marked up as follows:
-   </p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-   void Release ( void ) {
-      unsigned int newCount = atomic_decrement(&amp;mRefCount);
-      if (newCount == 0) {
-         ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER(&amp;mRefCount);
-         ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE_FORGET_ALL(&amp;mRefCount);
-         delete this;
-      } else {
-         ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE(&amp;mRefCount);
-      }
-   }
-</pre>
-<p>
-      There are a number of complex, mostly-theoretical objections to
-      this scheme.  From a theoretical standpoint it appears to be
-      impossible to devise a markup scheme which is completely correct
-      in the sense of guaranteeing to remove all false races.  The
-      proposed scheme however works well in practice.
-    </p>

-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Avoid memory recycling.  If you can't avoid it, you must use
-    tell Helgrind what is going on via the
-    <code class="function">VALGRIND_HG_CLEAN_MEMORY</code> client request (in
-    <code class="computeroutput">helgrind.h</code>).</p>
-<p>Helgrind is aware of standard heap memory allocation and
-    deallocation that occurs via
-    <code class="function">malloc</code>/<code class="function">free</code>/<code class="function">new</code>/<code class="function">delete</code>
-    and from entry and exit of stack frames.  In particular, when memory is
-    deallocated via <code class="function">free</code>, <code class="function">delete</code>,
-    or function exit, Helgrind considers that memory clean, so when it is
-    eventually reallocated, its history is irrelevant.</p>
-<p>However, it is common practice to implement memory recycling
-    schemes.  In these, memory to be freed is not handed to
-    <code class="function">free</code>/<code class="function">delete</code>, but instead put
-    into a pool of free buffers to be handed out again as required.  The
-    problem is that Helgrind has no
-    way to know that such memory is logically no longer in use, and
-    its history is irrelevant.  Hence you must make that explicit,
-    using the <code class="function">VALGRIND_HG_CLEAN_MEMORY</code> client request
-    to specify the relevant address ranges.  It's easiest to put these
-    requests into the pool manager code, and use them either when memory is
-    returned to the pool, or is allocated from it.</p>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Avoid POSIX condition variables.  If you can, use POSIX
-    semaphores (<code class="function">sem_t</code>, <code class="function">sem_post</code>,
-    <code class="function">sem_wait</code>) to do inter-thread event signalling.
-    Semaphores with an initial value of zero are particularly useful for
-    this.</p>
-<p>Helgrind only partially correctly handles POSIX condition
-    variables.  This is because Helgrind can see inter-thread
-    dependencies between a <code class="function">pthread_cond_wait</code> call and a
-    <code class="function">pthread_cond_signal</code>/<code class="function">pthread_cond_broadcast</code>
-    call only if the waiting thread actually gets to the rendezvous first
-    (so that it actually calls
-    <code class="function">pthread_cond_wait</code>).  It can't see dependencies
-    between the threads if the signaller arrives first.  In the latter case,
-    POSIX guidelines imply that the associated boolean condition still
-    provides an inter-thread synchronisation event, but one which is
-    invisible to Helgrind.</p>
-<p>The result of Helgrind missing some inter-thread
-    synchronisation events is to cause it to report false positives.
-    </p>
-<p>The root cause of this synchronisation lossage is
-    particularly hard to understand, so an example is helpful.  It was
-    discussed at length by Arndt Muehlenfeld ("Runtime Race Detection
-    in Multi-Threaded Programs", Dissertation, TU Graz, Austria).  The
-    canonical POSIX-recommended usage scheme for condition variables
-    is as follows:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-b   is a Boolean condition, which is False most of the time
-cv  is a condition variable
-mx  is its associated mutex
-
-Signaller:                             Waiter:
-
-lock(mx)                               lock(mx)
-b = True                               while (b == False)
-signal(cv)                                wait(cv,mx)
-unlock(mx)                             unlock(mx)
-</pre>
-<p>Assume <code class="computeroutput">b</code> is False most of
-    the time.  If the waiter arrives at the rendezvous first, it
-    enters its while-loop, waits for the signaller to signal, and
-    eventually proceeds.  Helgrind sees the signal, notes the
-    dependency, and all is well.</p>
-<p>If the signaller arrives
-    first, <code class="computeroutput">b</code> is set to true, and the
-    signal disappears into nowhere.  When the waiter later arrives, it
-    does not enter its while-loop and simply carries on.  But even in
-    this case, the waiter code following the while-loop cannot execute
-    until the signaller sets <code class="computeroutput">b</code> to
-    True.  Hence there is still the same inter-thread dependency, but
-    this time it is through an arbitrary in-memory condition, and
-    Helgrind cannot see it.</p>
-<p>By comparison, Helgrind's detection of inter-thread
-    dependencies caused by semaphore operations is believed to be
-    exactly correct.</p>
-<p>As far as I know, a solution to this problem that does not
-    require source-level annotation of condition-variable wait loops
-    is beyond the current state of the art.</p>

-<p>Using <code class="function">pthread_join</code> to round up finished

-        older, conflicting access. To limit memory usage, "old" accesses
-        stack traces are limited to a maximum of 8 entries, even if

-<p>Collecting such information is expensive in both speed and

-        a cache of limited size, with LRU-style management.  This is
-        necessary because it isn't practical to store a stack trace
-        for every single memory access made by the program.
-        Historical information on not recently accessed locations is
-        periodically discarded, to free up space in the cache.</p>
-<p>This option controls the size of the cache, in terms of the
-        number of different memory addresses for which
-        conflicting access information is stored.  If you find that
-        Helgrind is showing race errors with only one stack instead of
-        the expected two stacks, try increasing this value.</p>
-<p>The minimum value is 10,000 and the maximum is 30,000,000
-        (thirty times the default value).  Increasing the value by 1
-        increases Helgrind's memory requirement by very roughly 100
-        bytes, so the maximum value will easily eat up three extra
-        gigabytes or so of memory.</p>

-<dd><p>
-        By default Helgrind checks all data memory accesses made by your
-        program.  This flag enables you to skip checking for accesses
-        to thread stacks (local variables).  This can improve
-        performance, but comes at the cost of missing races on
-        stack-allocated data.

-some time.</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>For lock order errors, print the complete lock
-    cycle, rather than only doing for size-2 cycles as at
-    present.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>The conflicting access mechanism sometimes
-    mysteriously fails to show the conflicting access' stack, even
-    when provided with unbounded storage for conflicting access info.
-    This should be investigated.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Document races caused by GCC's thread-unsafe code

-    and <code class="computeroutput">http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/24/673</code>.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Don't update the lock-order graph, and don't check
-    for errors, when a "try"-style lock operation happens (e.g.
-    <code class="function">pthread_mutex_trylock</code>).  Such calls do not add any real
-    restrictions to the locking order, since they can always fail to
-    acquire the lock, resulting in the caller going off and doing Plan
-    B (presumably it will have a Plan B).  Doing such checks could
-    generate false lock-order errors and confuse users.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p> Performance can be very poor.  Slowdowns on the
-    order of 100:1 are not unusual.  There is limited scope for
-    performance improvements.

-<p>Lackey is a simple Valgrind tool that does various kinds of basic

-<p>This chapter describes advanced aspects of the Valgrind core
-services, which are mostly of interest to power users who wish to
-customise and modify Valgrind's default behaviours in certain useful
-ways.  The subjects covered are:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>The "Client Request" mechanism</p></li>

-<div class="sect1" title="3.1.The Client Request mechanism">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="manual-core-adv.clientreq"></a>3.1.The Client Request mechanism</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Valgrind has a trapdoor mechanism via which the client
-program can pass all manner of requests and queries to Valgrind
-and the current tool.  Internally, this is used extensively 
-to make various things work, although that's not visible from the
-outside.</p>
-<p>For your convenience, a subset of these so-called client
-requests is provided to allow you to tell Valgrind facts about
-the behaviour of your program, and also to make queries.
-In particular, your program can tell Valgrind about things that it
-otherwise would not know, leading to better results.
-</p>
-<p>Clients need to include a header file to make this work.
-Which header file depends on which client requests you use.  Some
-client requests are handled by the core, and are defined in the
-header file <code class="filename">valgrind/valgrind.h</code>.  Tool-specific
-header files are named after the tool, e.g.
-<code class="filename">valgrind/memcheck.h</code>.  Each tool-specific header file
-includes <code class="filename">valgrind/valgrind.h</code> so you don't need to
-include it in your client if you include a tool-specific header.  All header
-files can be found in the <code class="literal">include/valgrind</code> directory of
-wherever Valgrind was installed.</p>
-<p>The macros in these header files have the magical property
-that they generate code in-line which Valgrind can spot.
-However, the code does nothing when not run on Valgrind, so you
-are not forced to run your program under Valgrind just because you
-use the macros in this file.  Also, you are not required to link your
-program with any extra supporting libraries.</p>
-<p>The code added to your binary has negligible performance impact:
-on x86, amd64, ppc32, ppc64 and ARM, the overhead is 6 simple integer
-instructions and is probably undetectable except in tight loops.
-However, if you really wish to compile out the client requests, you
-can compile with <code class="option">-DNVALGRIND</code> (analogous to
-<code class="option">-DNDEBUG</code>'s effect on
-<code class="function">assert</code>).
-</p>
-<p>You are encouraged to copy the <code class="filename">valgrind/*.h</code> headers
-into your project's include directory, so your program doesn't have a
-compile-time dependency on Valgrind being installed.  The Valgrind headers,
-unlike most of the rest of the code, are under a BSD-style license so you may
-include them without worrying about license incompatibility.</p>
-<p>Here is a brief description of the macros available in
-<code class="filename">valgrind.h</code>, which work with more than one
-tool (see the tool-specific documentation for explanations of the
-tool-specific macros).</p>
-<div class="variablelist"><dl>
-<dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong><code class="computeroutput">RUNNING_ON_VALGRIND</code></strong></span>:</span></dt>
-<dd><p>Returns 1 if running on Valgrind, 0 if running on the
-    real CPU.  If you are running Valgrind on itself, returns the
-    number of layers of Valgrind emulation you're running on.
-    </p></dd>
-<dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong><code class="computeroutput">VALGRIND_DISCARD_TRANSLATIONS</code>:</strong></span></span></dt>
-<dd>
-<p>Discards translations of code in the specified address
-    range.  Useful if you are debugging a JIT compiler or some other
-    dynamic code generation system.  After this call, attempts to
-    execute code in the invalidated address range will cause
-    Valgrind to make new translations of that code, which is
-    probably the semantics you want.  Note that code invalidations
-    are expensive because finding all the relevant translations
-    quickly is very difficult, so try not to call it often.
-    Note that you can be clever about
-    this: you only need to call it when an area which previously
-    contained code is overwritten with new code.  You can choose
-    to write code into fresh memory, and just call this
-    occasionally to discard large chunks of old code all at
-    once.</p>
-<p>
-    Alternatively, for transparent self-modifying-code support,
-    use<code class="option">--smc-check=all</code>, or run
-    on ppc32/Linux, ppc64/Linux or ARM/Linux.

-    useful in test harness code when combined with the
-    <code class="option">--log-fd=-1</code> option; this runs Valgrind silently,
-    but the client program can detect when errors occur.  Only useful
-    for tools that report errors, e.g. it's useful for Memcheck, but for
-    Cachegrind it will always return zero because Cachegrind doesn't

-    information about heap blocks will not do nearly as good a
-    job.  For example, Memcheck won't detect nearly as many
-    errors, and the error messages won't be as informative.  To
-    improve this situation, use this macro just after your custom

-<p>A program running under Valgrind is not executed directly by the
-CPU.  Instead it runs on a synthetic CPU provided by Valgrind.  This is
-why a debugger cannot debug your program when it runs on Valgrind.
-</p>
-<p>
-This section describes how GDB can interact with the
-Valgrind gdbserver to provide a fully debuggable program under
-Valgrind. Used in this way, GDB also provides an interactive usage of
-Valgrind core or tool functionalities, including incremental leak search
-under Memcheck and on-demand Massif snapshot production.
-</p>
-<div class="sect2" title="3.2.1.Quick Start: debugging in 3 steps">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-core-adv.gdbserver-simple"></a>3.2.1.Quick Start: debugging in 3 steps</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>The simplest way to get started is to run Valgrind with the
-flag <code class="option">--vgdb-error=0</code>.  Then follow the on-screen
-directions, which give you the precise commands needed to start GDB
-and connect it to your program.</p>
-<p>Otherwise, here's a slightly more verbose overview.</p>
-<p>If you want to debug a program with GDB when using the Memcheck
-tool, start Valgrind like this:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-valgrind --vgdb=yes --vgdb-error=0 prog
-</pre>
-<p>In another shell, start GDB:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-gdb prog
-</pre>
-<p>Then give the following command to GDB:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-(gdb) target remote | vgdb
-</pre>
-<p>You can now debug your program e.g. by inserting a breakpoint
-and then using the GDB <code class="computeroutput">continue</code>
-command.</p>
-<p>This quick start information is enough for basic usage of the
-Valgrind gdbserver.  The sections below describe more advanced
-functionality provided by the combination of Valgrind and GDB. Note
-that the command line flag <code class="option">--vgdb=yes</code> can be omitted,
-as this is the default value.
-</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="3.2.2.Valgrind gdbserver overall organisation">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-core-adv.gdbserver-concept"></a>3.2.2.Valgrind gdbserver overall organisation</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>The GNU GDB debugger is typically used to debug a process
-running on the same machine.  In this mode, GDB uses system calls to
-control and query the program being debugged.  This works well, but
-only allows GDB to debug a program running on the same computer.
-</p>
-<p>GDB can also debug processes running on a different computer.
-To achieve this, GDB defines a protocol (that is, a set of query and
-reply packets) that facilitates fetching the value of memory or
-registers, setting breakpoints, etc.  A gdbserver is an implementation
-of this "GDB remote debugging" protocol.  To debug a process running
-on a remote computer, a gdbserver (sometimes called a GDB stub)
-must run at the remote computer side.
-</p>
-<p>The Valgrind core provides a built-in gdbserver implementation,
-which is activated using <code class="option">--vgdb=yes</code>
-or <code class="option">--vgdb=full</code>.  This gdbserver allows the process
-running on Valgrind's synthetic CPU to be debugged remotely.
-GDB sends protocol query packets (such as "get register contents") to
-the Valgrind embedded gdbserver.  The gdbserver executes the queries
-(for example, it will get the register values of the synthetic CPU)
-and gives the results back to GDB.
-</p>
-<p>GDB can use various kinds of channels (TCP/IP, serial line, etc)
-to communicate with the gdbserver.  In the case of Valgrind's
-gdbserver, communication is done via a pipe and a small helper program
-called <a class="xref" href="manual-core-adv.html#manual-core-adv.vgdb" title="3.2.9.vgdb command line options">vgdb</a>, which acts as an
-intermediary.  If no GDB is in use, vgdb can also be
-used to send monitor commands to the Valgrind gdbserver from a shell
-command line.
-</p>

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-core-adv.gdbserver-gdb"></a>3.2.3.Connecting GDB to a Valgrind gdbserver</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>To debug a program "<code class="filename">prog</code>" running under
-Valgrind, you must ensure that the Valgrind gdbserver is activated by
-specifying either <code class="option">--vgdb=yes</code>
-or <code class="option">--vgdb=full</code>.  A secondary command line option,
-<code class="option">--vgdb-error=number</code>, can be used to tell the gdbserver
-only to become active once the specified number of errors have been
-shown.  A value of zero will therefore cause
-the gdbserver to become active at startup, which allows you to
-insert breakpoints before starting the run.  For example:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-valgrind --tool=memcheck --vgdb=yes --vgdb-error=0 ./prog
-</pre>
-<p>The Valgrind gdbserver is invoked at startup
-and indicates it is waiting for a connection from a GDB:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-==2418== Memcheck, a memory error detector
-==2418== Copyright (C) 2002-2010, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.
-==2418== Using Valgrind-3.7.0.SVN and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info
-==2418== Command: ./prog
-==2418== 
-==2418== (action at startup) vgdb me ... 
-</pre>
-<p>GDB (in another shell) can then be connected to the Valgrind gdbserver.
-For this, GDB must be started on the program <code class="filename">prog</code>:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-gdb ./prog
-</pre>
-<p>You then indicate to GDB that you want to debug a remote target:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-(gdb) target remote | vgdb
-</pre>
-<p>
-GDB then starts a vgdb relay application to communicate with the 
-Valgrind embedded gdbserver:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">

-<p>Note that vgdb is provided as part of the Valgrind
-distribution.  You do not need to install it separately.</p>
-<p>If vgdb detects that there are multiple Valgrind gdbservers that
-can be connected to, it will list all such servers and their PIDs, and
-then exit.  You can then reissue the GDB "target" command, but
-specifying the PID of the process you want to debug:

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-core-adv.gdbserver-gdb-android"></a>3.2.4.Connecting to an Android gdbserver</h3></div></div></div>
-<p> When developping applications for Android, you will typically use
-a development system (on which the Android NDK is installed) to compile your
-application. An Android target system or emulator will be used to run
-the application.
-In this setup, Valgrind and vgdb will run on the Android system,
-while GDB will run on the development system. GDB will connect
-to the vgdb running on the Android system using the Android NDK
-'adb forward' application.
-</p>
-<p> Example: on the Android system, execute the following:
-    </p>
-<pre class="screen">
-valgrind --vgdb-error=0 --vgdb=yes prog
-# and then in another shell, run:
-vgdb --port=1234
-</pre>
-<p>
-</p>
-<p> On the development system, execute the following commands:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-adb forward tcp:1234 tcp:1234
-gdb prog
-(gdb) target remote :1234
-</pre>
-<p>
-GDB will use a local tcp/ip connection to connect to the Android adb forwarder.
-Adb will establish a relay connection between the host system and the Android
-target system.  Be sure to use the GDB delivered in the
-Android NDK system (typically, arm-linux-androideabi-gdb), as the host
-GDB is probably not able to debug Android arm applications.
-Note that the local port nr (used by GDB) must not necessarily be equal
-to the port number used by vgdb: adb can forward tcp/ip between different
-port numbers.
-</p>
-<p>In the current release, the GDB server is not enabled by default
-for Android, due to problems in establishing a suitable directory in
-which Valgrind can create the necessary FIFOs (named pipes) for
-communication purposes.  You can stil try to use the GDB server, but
-you will need to explicitly enable it using the flag 
-<code class="computeroutput">--vgdb=yes</code> or
-<code class="computeroutput">--vgdb=full</code>.
-</p>
-<p>Additionally, you
-will need to select a temporary directory which is (a) writable
-by Valgrind, and (b) supports FIFOs.  This is the main difficult
-point.  Often, <code class="computeroutput">/sdcard</code> satisfies
-requirement (a), but fails for (b) because it is a VFAT file system
-and VFAT does not support pipes.  Possibilities you could try are
-<code class="computeroutput">/data/local</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">/data/local/Inst</code> (if you
-installed Valgrind there), or
-<code class="computeroutput">/data/data/name.of.my.app</code>, if you
-are running a specific application and it has its own directory of 
-that form.  This last possibility may have the highest probability
-of success.</p>
-<p>You can specify the temporary directory to use either via
-the <code class="computeroutput">--with-tmpdir=</code> configure time
-flag, or by setting environment variable TMPDIR when running Valgrind
-(on the Android device, not on the Android NDK development host).
-Another alternative is to specify the directory for the FIFOs using
-the <code class="computeroutput">--vgdb-prefix=</code> Valgrind command
-line option.
-</p>
-<p>We hope to have a better story for temporary directory handling
-on Android in the future.  The difficulty is that, unlike in standard
-Unixes, there is no single temporary file directory that reliably
-works across all devices and scenarios.

-<p> The Valgrind gdbserver provides additional Valgrind-specific

-<p>The following tools provide tool-specific monitor commands:

-<p>
-</p>
-<p>An example of a tool specific monitor command is the Memcheck monitor
-command <code class="computeroutput">leak_check full
-reachable any</code>.  This requests a full reporting of the
-allocated memory blocks.  To have this leak check executed, use the GDB
-command:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-(gdb) monitor leak_check full reachable any
-</pre>
-<p>
-</p>
-<p>GDB will send the <code class="computeroutput">leak_check</code>
-command to the Valgrind gdbserver.  The Valgrind gdbserver will
-execute the monitor command itself, if it recognises it to be a Valgrind core
-monitor command.  If it is not recognised as such, it is assumed to
-be tool-specific and is handed to the tool for execution.  For example:
-</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-(gdb) monitor leak_check full reachable any
-==2418== 100 bytes in 1 blocks are still reachable in loss record 1 of 1
-==2418==    at 0x4006E9E: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:236)
-==2418==    by 0x804884F: main (prog.c:88)
-==2418== 
-==2418== LEAK SUMMARY:
-==2418==    definitely lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
-==2418==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
-==2418==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
-==2418==    still reachable: 100 bytes in 1 blocks
-==2418==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
-==2418== 
-(gdb) 
-</pre>
-<p>As with other GDB commands, the Valgrind gdbserver will accept
-abbreviated monitor command names and arguments, as long as the given
-abbreviation is unambiguous.  For example, the above
-<code class="computeroutput">leak_check</code>
-command can also be typed as:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-(gdb) mo l f r a
-</pre>
-<p>
-
-The letters <code class="computeroutput">mo</code> are recognised by GDB as being
-an abbreviation for <code class="computeroutput">monitor</code>.  So GDB sends the
-string <code class="computeroutput">l f r a</code> to the Valgrind
-gdbserver.  The letters provided in this string are unambiguous for the
-Valgrind gdbserver.  This therefore gives the same output as the
-unabbreviated command and arguments.  If the provided abbreviation is
-ambiguous, the Valgrind gdbserver will report the list of commands (or
-argument values) that can match:
-</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-(gdb) mo v. n
-v. can match v.set v.info v.wait v.kill v.translate
-(gdb) mo v.i n
-n_errs_found 0 n_errs_shown 0 (vgdb-error 0)
-(gdb) 
-</pre>
-<p>
-</p>
-<p>Instead of sending a monitor command from GDB, you can also send
-these from a shell command line.  For example, the following command
-lines, when given in a shell, will cause the same leak search to be executed
-by the process 3145:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-vgdb --pid=3145 leak_check full reachable any
-vgdb --pid=3145 l f r a
-</pre>
-<p>Note that the Valgrind gdbserver automatically continues the
-execution of the program after a standalone invocation of
-vgdb.  Monitor commands sent from GDB do not cause the program to
-continue: the program execution is controlled explicitly using GDB
-commands such as "continue" or "next".</p>

-<p> When the option <code class="option">--vgdb-shadow-registers=yes</code> is

-Valgrind's shadow registers.  GDB version 7.1 or later is needed for this
-to work. For x86 and amd64, GDB version 7.2 or later is needed.</p>
-<p>For each CPU register, the Valgrind core maintains two
-shadow register sets.  These shadow registers can be accessed from
-GDB by giving a postfix <code class="computeroutput">s1</code>
-or <code class="computeroutput">s2</code> for respectively the first
-and second shadow register.  For example, the x86 register
-<code class="computeroutput">eax</code> and its two shadows
-can be examined using the following commands:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-(gdb) p $eax
-$1 = 0
-(gdb) p $eaxs1
-$2 = 0
-(gdb) p $eaxs2

-(gdb)

-<p>Float shadow registers are shown by GDB as unsigned integer
-values instead of float values, as it is expected that these
-shadow values are mostly used for memcheck validity bits. </p>
-<p>Intel/amd64 AVX registers <code class="computeroutput">ymm0</code>
-to <code class="computeroutput">ymm15</code> have also their shadow
-registers. However, GDB presents the shadow values using two
-"half" registers. For example, the half shadow registers for 
-<code class="computeroutput">ymm9</code> are
-<code class="computeroutput">xmm9s1</code> (lower half for set 1),
-<code class="computeroutput">ymm9hs1</code> (upper half for set 1),
-<code class="computeroutput">xmm9s2</code> (lower half for set 2),
-<code class="computeroutput">ymm9hs2</code> (upper half for set 2).
-Note the inconsistent notation for the names of the half registers:
-the lower part starts with an <code class="computeroutput">x</code>,
-the upper part starts with an <code class="computeroutput">y</code>
-and has an <code class="computeroutput">h</code> before the shadow postfix.
-</p>
-<p>The special presentation of the AVX shadow registers is due to
-the fact that GDB independently retrieves the lower and upper half of
-the <code class="computeroutput">ymm</code> registers.  GDB does not
-however know that the shadow half registers have to be shown combined.

-<p>Debugging with the Valgrind gdbserver is very similar to native
-debugging.  Valgrind's gdbserver implementation is quite
-complete, and so provides most of the GDB debugging functionality.  There
-are however some limitations and peculiarities:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Precision of "stop-at" commands.</p>
-<p>
-       GDB commands such as "step", "next", "stepi", breakpoints
-       and watchpoints, will stop the execution of the process.  With
-       the option <code class="option">--vgdb=yes</code>, the process might not
-       stop at the exact requested instruction. Instead, it might
-       continue execution of the current basic block and stop at one
-       of the following basic blocks. This is linked to the fact that
-       Valgrind gdbserver has to instrument a block to allow stopping
-       at the exact instruction requested.  Currently,
-       re-instrumentation of the block currently being executed is not
-       supported. So, if the action requested by GDB (e.g. single
-       stepping or inserting a breakpoint) implies re-instrumentation
-       of the current block, the GDB action may not be executed
-       precisely.
-     </p>
-<p>
-       This limitation applies when the basic block
-       currently being executed has not yet been instrumented for debugging.
-       This typically happens when the gdbserver is activated due to the
-       tool reporting an error or to a watchpoint.  If the gdbserver
-       block has been activated following a breakpoint, or if a
-       breakpoint has been inserted in the block before its execution,
-       then the block has already been instrumented for debugging.
-     </p>
-<p>
-       If you use the option <code class="option">--vgdb=full</code>, then GDB
-       "stop-at" commands will be obeyed precisely.  The
-       downside is that this requires each instruction to be
-       instrumented with an additional call to a gdbserver helper
-       function, which gives considerable overhead (+500% for memcheck)
-       compared to  <code class="option">--vgdb=no</code>.
-       Option <code class="option">--vgdb=yes</code> has neglectible overhead compared

-<p>Processor registers and flags values.</p>
-<p>When Valgrind gdbserver stops on an error, on a breakpoint

-<p>Hardware watchpoint support by the Valgrind
-     gdbserver.</p>
-<p> The Valgrind gdbserver can simulate hardware watchpoints
-     if the selected tool provides support for it.  Currently,
-     only Memcheck provides hardware watchpoint simulation.  The
-     hardware watchpoint simulation provided by Memcheck is much
-     faster that GDB software watchpoints, which are implemented by
-     GDB checking the value of the watched zone(s) after each
-     instruction.  Hardware watchpoint simulation also provides read
-     watchpoints.  The hardware watchpoint simulation by Memcheck has
-     some limitations compared to real hardware
-     watchpoints. However, the number and length of simulated
-     watchpoints are not limited.
-     </p>
-<p>Typically, the number of (real) hardware watchpoints is
-     limited.  For example, the x86 architecture supports a maximum of
-     4 hardware watchpoints, each watchpoint watching 1, 2, 4 or 8
-     bytes. The Valgrind gdbserver does not have any limitation on the
-     number of simulated hardware watchpoints. It also has no
-     limitation on the length of the memory zone being
-     watched.  Using GDB version 7.4 or later allow full use of the
-     flexibility of the Valgrind gdbserver's simulated hardware watchpoints.
-     Previous GDB versions do not understand that Valgrind gdbserver
-     watchpoints have no length limit.
-     </p>
-<p>Memcheck implements hardware watchpoint simulation by
-     marking the watched address ranges as being unaddressable.  When
-     a hardware watchpoint is removed, the range is marked as
-     addressable and defined.  Hardware watchpoint simulation of
-     addressable-but-undefined memory zones works properly, but has
-     the undesirable side effect of marking the zone as defined when
-     the watchpoint is removed.
-     </p>
-<p>Write watchpoints might not be reported at the 
-     exact instruction that writes the monitored area,
-     unless option <code class="option">--vgdb=full</code> is given.  Read watchpoints
-     will always be reported at the exact instruction reading the
-     watched memory.
-     </p>
-<p>It is better to avoid using hardware watchpoint of not
-     addressable (yet) memory: in such a case, GDB will fall back to
-     extremely slow software watchpoints.  Also, if you do not quit GDB
-     between two debugging sessions, the hardware watchpoints of the
-     previous sessions will be re-inserted as software watchpoints if
-     the watched memory zone is not addressable at program startup.

-<p>Execution of Inferior function calls by the Valgrind
-     gdbserver.</p>
-<p>GDB allows the user to "call" functions inside the process
-     being debugged.  Such calls are named "inferior calls" in the GDB
-     terminology.  A typical use of an inferior call is to execute
-     a function that prints a human-readable version of a complex data
-     structure.  To make an inferior call, use the GDB "print" command
-     followed by the function to call and its arguments.  As an
-     example, the following GDB command causes an inferior call to the
-     libc "printf" function to be executed by the process
-     being debugged:
-     </p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-(gdb) p printf("process being debugged has pid %d\n", getpid())
-$5 = 36
-(gdb) 
-</pre>
-<p>The Valgrind gdbserver supports inferior function calls.
-     Whilst an inferior call is running, the Valgrind tool will report
-     errors as usual.  If you do not want to have such errors stop the
-     execution of the inferior call, you can
-     use <code class="computeroutput">v.set vgdb-error</code> to set a
-     big value before the call, then manually reset it to its original
-     value when the call is complete.</p>
-<p>To execute inferior calls, GDB changes registers such as
-     the program counter, and then continues the execution of the
-     program. In a multithreaded program, all threads are continued,
-     not just the thread instructed to make the inferior call.  If
-     another thread reports an error or encounters a breakpoint, the
-     evaluation of the inferior call is abandoned.</p>
-<p>Note that inferior function calls are a powerful GDB
-     feature, but should be used with caution. For example, if
-     the program being debugged is stopped inside the function "printf",
-     forcing a recursive call to printf via an inferior call will
-     very probably create problems.  The Valgrind tool might also add
-     another level of complexity to inferior calls, e.g. by reporting
-     tool errors during the Inferior call or due to the
-     instrumentation done.

-<p>Connecting to or interrupting a Valgrind process blocked in
-     a system call.</p>
-<p>Connecting to or interrupting a Valgrind process blocked in
-     a system call requires the "ptrace" system call to be usable.
-     This may be disabled in your kernel for security reasons.</p>
-<p>When running your program, Valgrind's scheduler
-     periodically checks whether there is any work to be handled by
-     the gdbserver.  Unfortunately this check is only done if at least
-     one thread of the process is runnable.  If all the threads of the
-     process are blocked in a system call, then the checks do not
-     happen, and the Valgrind scheduler will not invoke the gdbserver.
-     In such a case, the vgdb relay application will "force" the
-     gdbserver to be invoked, without the intervention of the Valgrind
-     scheduler.
-     </p>
-<p>Such forced invocation of the Valgrind gdbserver is
-     implemented by vgdb using ptrace system calls.  On a properly
-     implemented kernel, the ptrace calls done by vgdb will not
-     influence the behaviour of the program running under Valgrind.
-     If however they do, giving the
-     option <code class="option">--max-invoke-ms=0</code> to the vgdb relay
-     application will disable the usage of ptrace calls.  The
-     consequence of disabling ptrace usage in vgdb is that a Valgrind
-     process blocked in a system call cannot be woken up or
-     interrupted from GDB until it executes enough basic blocks to let
-     the Valgrind scheduler's normal checking take effect.
-     </p>
-<p>When ptrace is disabled in vgdb, you can increase the
-     responsiveness of the Valgrind gdbserver to commands or
-     interrupts by giving a lower value to the
-     option <code class="option">--vgdb-poll</code>.  If your application is
-     blocked in system calls most of the time, using a very low value
-     for <code class="option">--vgdb-poll</code> will cause a the gdbserver to be
-     invoked sooner.  The gdbserver polling done by Valgrind's
-     scheduler is very efficient, so the increased polling frequency
-     should not cause significant performance degradation.
-     </p>
-<p>When ptrace is disabled in vgdb, a query packet sent by GDB
-     may take significant time to be handled by the Valgrind
-     gdbserver.  In such cases, GDB might encounter a protocol
-     timeout.  To avoid this,
-     you can increase the value of the timeout by using the GDB
-     command "set remotetimeout".
-     </p>
-<p>Ubuntu versions 10.10 and later may restrict the scope of
-     ptrace to the children of the process calling ptrace.  As the
-     Valgrind process is not a child of vgdb, such restricted scoping
-     causes the ptrace calls to fail.  To avoid that, when Valgrind
-     gdbserver receives the first packet from a vgdb, it calls
-     <code class="computeroutput">prctl(PR_SET_PTRACER, vgdb_pid, 0, 0,
-     0)</code> to ensure vgdb can reliably use ptrace.
-     Once <code class="computeroutput">vgdb_pid</code> has been marked as
-     a ptracer, vgdb can then properly force the invocation of
-     Valgrind gdbserver when needed.  To ensure the vgdb is set as a
-     ptracer before the Valgrind process gets blocked in a system
-     call, connect your GDB to the Valgrind gdbserver at startup by
-     passing <code class="option">--vgdb-error=0</code> to Valgrind.</p>
-<p>Note that
-     this "set ptracer" technique does not solve the problem in the
-     case where a standalone vgdb process wants to connect to the
-     gdbserver, since the first command to be sent by a standalone
-     vgdb must wake up the Valgrind process before Valgrind gdbserver
-     will mark vgdb as a ptracer.
-     </p>
-<p>Unblocking processes blocked in system calls is not

-<p> Usage: <code class="computeroutput">vgdb [OPTION]... [[-c] COMMAND]...</code></p>
-<p> vgdb ("Valgrind to GDB") is a small program that is used as an
-intermediary between Valgrind and GDB or a shell.
-Therefore, it has two usage modes:
-</p>
-<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
-<li class="listitem"><p><a name="manual-core-adv.vgdb-standalone"></a>As a standalone utility, it is used from a shell command
-    line to send monitor commands to a process running under
-    Valgrind. For this usage, the vgdb OPTION(s) must be followed by
-    the monitor command to send. To send more than one command,
-    separate them with the <code class="option">-c</code> option.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><a name="manual-core-adv.vgdb-relay"></a>In combination with GDB "target remote |" command, it is
-    used as the relay application between GDB and the Valgrind
-    gdbserver.  For this usage, only OPTION(s) can be given, but no
-    COMMAND can be given.
-    </p></li>
-</ol></div>
-<p><code class="computeroutput">vgdb</code> accepts the following
-options:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="option">--pid=&lt;number&gt;</code>: specifies the PID of
-    the process to which vgdb must connect to.  This option is useful
-    in case more than one Valgrind gdbserver can be connected to.  If
-    the <code class="option">--pid</code> argument is not given and multiple
-    Valgrind gdbserver processes are running, vgdb will report the
-    list of such processes and then exit.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="option">--vgdb-prefix</code> must be given to both
-    Valgrind and vgdb if you want to change the default prefix for the
-    FIFOs (named pipes) used for communication between the Valgrind
-    gdbserver and vgdb. </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="option">--wait=&lt;number&gt;</code> instructs vgdb to
-    search for available Valgrind gdbservers for the specified number
-    of seconds.  This makes it possible start a vgdb process 
-    before starting the Valgrind gdbserver with which you intend the
-    vgdb to communicate.  This option is useful when used in
-    conjunction with a <code class="option">--vgdb-prefix</code> that is
-    unique to the process you want to wait for.
-    Also, if you use the <code class="option">--wait</code> argument in the GDB
-    "target remote" command, you must set the GDB remotetimeout to a
-    value bigger than the --wait argument value.  See option
-    <code class="option">--max-invoke-ms</code> (just below)
-    for an example of setting the remotetimeout value.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p><code class="option">--max-invoke-ms=&lt;number&gt;</code> gives the
-    number of milliseconds after which vgdb will force the invocation
-    of gdbserver embedded in Valgrind.  The default value is 100
-    milliseconds. A value of 0 disables forced invocation. The forced
-    invocation is used when vgdb is connected to a Valgrind gdbserver,
-    and the Valgrind process has all its threads blocked in a system
-    call.
-    </p>
-<p>If you specify a large value, you might need to increase the
-    GDB "remotetimeout" value from its default value of 2 seconds.
-    You should ensure that the timeout (in seconds) is
-    bigger than the <code class="option">--max-invoke-ms</code> value.  For

-    running on another target computer.

-<p>
-Valgrind allows calls to some specified functions to be intercepted and
-rerouted to a different, user-supplied function.  This can do whatever it
-likes, typically examining the arguments, calling onwards to the original,
-and possibly examining the result.  Any number of functions may be
-wrapped.</p>
-<p>
-Function wrapping is useful for instrumenting an API in some way.  For
-example, Helgrind wraps functions in the POSIX pthreads API so it can know
-about thread status changes, and the core is able to wrap
-functions in the MPI (message-passing) API so it can know
-of memory status changes associated with message arrival/departure.
-Such information is usually passed to Valgrind by using client
-requests in the wrapper functions, although the exact mechanism may vary.
-</p>
-<div class="sect2" title="3.3.1.A Simple Example">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-core-adv.wrapping.example"></a>3.3.1.A Simple Example</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Supposing we want to wrap some function</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-int foo ( int x, int y ) { return x + y; }</pre>
-<p>A wrapper is a function of identical type, but with a special name
-which identifies it as the wrapper for <code class="computeroutput">foo</code>.
-Wrappers need to include
-supporting macros from <code class="filename">valgrind.h</code>.
-Here is a simple wrapper which prints the arguments and return value:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
-#include "valgrind.h"
-int I_WRAP_SONAME_FNNAME_ZU(NONE,foo)( int x, int y )
-{
-   int    result;
-   OrigFn fn;
-   VALGRIND_GET_ORIG_FN(fn);
-   printf("foo's wrapper: args %d %d\n", x, y);
-   CALL_FN_W_WW(result, fn, x,y);
-   printf("foo's wrapper: result %d\n", result);
-   return result;
-}
-</pre>
-<p>To become active, the wrapper merely needs to be present in a text
-section somewhere in the same process' address space as the function
-it wraps, and for its ELF symbol name to be visible to Valgrind.  In
-practice, this means either compiling to a 
-<code class="computeroutput">.o</code> and linking it in, or
-compiling to a <code class="computeroutput">.so</code> and 
-<code class="computeroutput">LD_PRELOAD</code>ing it in.  The latter is more
-convenient in that it doesn't require relinking.</p>
-<p>All wrappers have approximately the above form.  There are three
-crucial macros:</p>
-<p><code class="computeroutput">I_WRAP_SONAME_FNNAME_ZU</code>: 
-this generates the real name of the wrapper.
-This is an encoded name which Valgrind notices when reading symbol
-table information.  What it says is: I am the wrapper for any function
-named <code class="computeroutput">foo</code> which is found in 
-an ELF shared object with an empty
-("<code class="computeroutput">NONE</code>") soname field.  The specification 
-mechanism is powerful in
-that wildcards are allowed for both sonames and function names.  
-The details are discussed below.</p>
-<p><code class="computeroutput">VALGRIND_GET_ORIG_FN</code>: 
-once in the the wrapper, the first priority is
-to get hold of the address of the original (and any other supporting
-information needed).  This is stored in a value of opaque 
-type <code class="computeroutput">OrigFn</code>.
-The information is acquired using 
-<code class="computeroutput">VALGRIND_GET_ORIG_FN</code>.  It is crucial
-to make this macro call before calling any other wrapped function
-in the same thread.</p>
-<p><code class="computeroutput">CALL_FN_W_WW</code>: eventually we will
-want to call the function being
-wrapped.  Calling it directly does not work, since that just gets us
-back to the wrapper and leads to an infinite loop.  Instead, the result
-lvalue, 
-<code class="computeroutput">OrigFn</code> and arguments are
-handed to one of a family of macros of the form 
-<code class="computeroutput">CALL_FN_*</code>.  These
-cause Valgrind to call the original and avoid recursion back to the
-wrapper.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="3.3.2.Wrapping Specifications">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-core-adv.wrapping.specs"></a>3.3.2.Wrapping Specifications</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>This scheme has the advantage of being self-contained.  A library of
-wrappers can be compiled to object code in the normal way, and does
-not rely on an external script telling Valgrind which wrappers pertain
-to which originals.</p>
-<p>Each wrapper has a name which, in the most general case says: I am the
-wrapper for any function whose name matches FNPATT and whose ELF
-"soname" matches SOPATT.  Both FNPATT and SOPATT may contain wildcards
-(asterisks) and other characters (spaces, dots, @, etc) which are not 
-generally regarded as valid C identifier names.</p>
-<p>This flexibility is needed to write robust wrappers for POSIX pthread
-functions, where typically we are not completely sure of either the
-function name or the soname, or alternatively we want to wrap a whole
-set of functions at once.</p>
-<p>For example, <code class="computeroutput">pthread_create</code> 
-in GNU libpthread is usually a
-versioned symbol - one whose name ends in, eg, 
-<code class="computeroutput">@GLIBC_2.3</code>.  Hence we
-are not sure what its real name is.  We also want to cover any soname
-of the form <code class="computeroutput">libpthread.so*</code>.
-So the header of the wrapper will be</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-int I_WRAP_SONAME_FNNAME_ZZ(libpthreadZdsoZd0,pthreadZucreateZAZa)
-  ( ... formals ... )
-  { ... body ... }
-</pre>
-<p>In order to write unusual characters as valid C function names, a
-Z-encoding scheme is used.  Names are written literally, except that
-a capital Z acts as an escape character, with the following encoding:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-     Za   encodes    *
-     Zp              +
-     Zc              :
-     Zd              .
-     Zu              _
-     Zh              -
-     Zs              (space)
-     ZA              @
-     ZZ              Z
-     ZL              (       # only in valgrind 3.3.0 and later
-     ZR              )       # only in valgrind 3.3.0 and later
-</pre>
-<p>Hence <code class="computeroutput">libpthreadZdsoZd0</code> is an 
-encoding of the soname <code class="computeroutput">libpthread.so.0</code>
-and <code class="computeroutput">pthreadZucreateZAZa</code> is an encoding 
-of the function name <code class="computeroutput">pthread_create@*</code>.
-</p>
-<p>The macro <code class="computeroutput">I_WRAP_SONAME_FNNAME_ZZ</code> 
-constructs a wrapper name in which
-both the soname (first component) and function name (second component)
-are Z-encoded.  Encoding the function name can be tiresome and is
-often unnecessary, so a second macro,
-<code class="computeroutput">I_WRAP_SONAME_FNNAME_ZU</code>, can be
-used instead.  The <code class="computeroutput">_ZU</code> variant is 
-also useful for writing wrappers for
-C++ functions, in which the function name is usually already mangled
-using some other convention in which Z plays an important role.  Having
-to encode a second time quickly becomes confusing.</p>
-<p>Since the function name field may contain wildcards, it can be
-anything, including just <code class="computeroutput">*</code>.
-The same is true for the soname.
-However, some ELF objects - specifically, main executables - do not
-have sonames.  Any object lacking a soname is treated as if its soname
-was <code class="computeroutput">NONE</code>, which is why the original 
-example above had a name
-<code class="computeroutput">I_WRAP_SONAME_FNNAME_ZU(NONE,foo)</code>.</p>
-<p>Note that the soname of an ELF object is not the same as its
-file name, although it is often similar.  You can find the soname of
-an object <code class="computeroutput">libfoo.so</code> using the command
-<code class="computeroutput">readelf -a libfoo.so | grep soname</code>.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="3.3.3.Wrapping Semantics">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-core-adv.wrapping.semantics"></a>3.3.3.Wrapping Semantics</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>The ability for a wrapper to replace an infinite family of functions
-is powerful but brings complications in situations where ELF objects
-appear and disappear (are dlopen'd and dlclose'd) on the fly.
-Valgrind tries to maintain sensible behaviour in such situations.</p>
-<p>For example, suppose a process has dlopened (an ELF object with
-soname) <code class="filename">object1.so</code>, which contains 
-<code class="computeroutput">function1</code>.  It starts to use
-<code class="computeroutput">function1</code> immediately.</p>
-<p>After a while it dlopens <code class="filename">wrappers.so</code>,
-which contains a wrapper
-for <code class="computeroutput">function1</code> in (soname) 
-<code class="filename">object1.so</code>.  All subsequent calls to 
-<code class="computeroutput">function1</code> are rerouted to the wrapper.</p>
-<p>If <code class="filename">wrappers.so</code> is 
-later dlclose'd, calls to <code class="computeroutput">function1</code> are 
-naturally routed back to the original.</p>
-<p>Alternatively, if <code class="filename">object1.so</code>
-is dlclose'd but <code class="filename">wrappers.so</code> remains,
-then the wrapper exported by <code class="filename">wrappers.so</code>
-becomes inactive, since there
-is no way to get to it - there is no original to call any more.  However,
-Valgrind remembers that the wrapper is still present.  If 
-<code class="filename">object1.so</code> is
-eventually dlopen'd again, the wrapper will become active again.</p>
-<p>In short, valgrind inspects all code loading/unloading events to
-ensure that the set of currently active wrappers remains consistent.</p>
-<p>A second possible problem is that of conflicting wrappers.  It is 
-easily possible to load two or more wrappers, both of which claim
-to be wrappers for some third function.  In such cases Valgrind will
-complain about conflicting wrappers when the second one appears, and
-will honour only the first one.</p>

-<p>Figuring out what's going on given the dynamic nature of wrapping
-can be difficult.  The 
-<code class="option">--trace-redir=yes</code> option makes 
-this possible
-by showing the complete state of the redirection subsystem after
-every
-<code class="function">mmap</code>/<code class="function">munmap</code>
-event affecting code (text).</p>
-<p>There are two central concepts:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>A "redirection specification" is a binding of 
-  a (soname pattern, fnname pattern) pair to a code address.
-  These bindings are created by writing functions with names
-  made with the 
-  <code class="computeroutput">I_WRAP_SONAME_FNNAME_{ZZ,_ZU}</code>
-  macros.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>An "active redirection" is a code-address to 
-  code-address binding currently in effect.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>The state of the wrapping-and-redirection subsystem comprises a set of
-specifications and a set of active bindings.  The specifications are
-acquired/discarded by watching all 
-<code class="function">mmap</code>/<code class="function">munmap</code>
-events on code (text)
-sections.  The active binding set is (conceptually) recomputed from
-the specifications, and all known symbol names, following any change
-to the specification set.</p>
-<p><code class="option">--trace-redir=yes</code> shows the contents 
-of both sets following any such event.</p>
-<p><code class="option">-v</code> prints a line of text each 
-time an active specification is used for the first time.</p>
-<p>Hence for maximum debugging effectiveness you will need to use both
-options.</p>
-<p>One final comment.  The function-wrapping facility is closely
-tied to Valgrind's ability to replace (redirect) specified
-functions, for example to redirect calls to 
-<code class="function">malloc</code> to its
-own implementation.  Indeed, a replacement function can be
-regarded as a wrapper function which does not call the original.
-However, to make the implementation more robust, the two kinds
-of interception (wrapping vs replacement) are treated differently.
-</p>
-<p><code class="option">--trace-redir=yes</code> shows 
-specifications and bindings for both
-replacement and wrapper functions.  To differentiate the 
-two, replacement bindings are printed using 
-<code class="computeroutput">R-&gt;</code> whereas 
-wraps are printed using <code class="computeroutput">W-&gt;</code>.
-</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="3.3.5.Limitations - control flow">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-core-adv.wrapping.limitations-cf"></a>3.3.5.Limitations - control flow</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>For the most part, the function wrapping implementation is robust.
-The only important caveat is: in a wrapper, get hold of
-the <code class="computeroutput">OrigFn</code> information using 
-<code class="computeroutput">VALGRIND_GET_ORIG_FN</code> before calling any
-other wrapped function.  Once you have the 
-<code class="computeroutput">OrigFn</code>, arbitrary
-calls between, recursion between, and longjumps out of wrappers
-should work correctly.  There is never any interaction between wrapped
-functions and merely replaced functions 
-(eg <code class="function">malloc</code>), so you can call
-<code class="function">malloc</code> etc safely from within wrappers.
-</p>
-<p>The above comments are true for {x86,amd64,ppc32,arm,mips32,s390}-linux.
-On
-ppc64-linux function wrapping is more fragile due to the (arguably
-poorly designed) ppc64-linux ABI.  This mandates the use of a shadow
-stack which tracks entries/exits of both wrapper and replacement
-functions.  This gives two limitations: firstly, longjumping out of
-wrappers will rapidly lead to disaster, since the shadow stack will
-not get correctly cleared.  Secondly, since the shadow stack has
-finite size, recursion between wrapper/replacement functions is only
-possible to a limited depth, beyond which Valgrind has to abort the
-run.  This depth is currently 16 calls.</p>
-<p>For all platforms ({x86,amd64,ppc32,ppc64,arm,mips32,s390}-linux)
-all the above
-comments apply on a per-thread basis.  In other words, wrapping is
-thread-safe: each thread must individually observe the above
-restrictions, but there is no need for any kind of inter-thread
-cooperation.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="3.3.6.Limitations - original function signatures">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-core-adv.wrapping.limitations-sigs"></a>3.3.6.Limitations - original function signatures</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>As shown in the above example, to call the original you must use a
-macro of the form <code class="computeroutput">CALL_FN_*</code>.  
-For technical reasons it is impossible
-to create a single macro to deal with all argument types and numbers,
-so a family of macros covering the most common cases is supplied.  In
-what follows, 'W' denotes a machine-word-typed value (a pointer or a
-C <code class="computeroutput">long</code>), 
-and 'v' denotes C's <code class="computeroutput">void</code> type.
-The currently available macros are:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-CALL_FN_v_v    -- call an original of type  void fn ( void )
-CALL_FN_W_v    -- call an original of type  long fn ( void )
-
-CALL_FN_v_W    -- call an original of type  void fn ( long )
-CALL_FN_W_W    -- call an original of type  long fn ( long )
-
-CALL_FN_v_WW   -- call an original of type  void fn ( long, long )
-CALL_FN_W_WW   -- call an original of type  long fn ( long, long )
-
-CALL_FN_v_WWW  -- call an original of type  void fn ( long, long, long )
-CALL_FN_W_WWW  -- call an original of type  long fn ( long, long, long )
-
-CALL_FN_W_WWWW -- call an original of type  long fn ( long, long, long, long )
-CALL_FN_W_5W   -- call an original of type  long fn ( long, long, long, long, long )
-CALL_FN_W_6W   -- call an original of type  long fn ( long, long, long, long, long, long )
-and so on, up to 
-CALL_FN_W_12W
-</pre>
-<p>The set of supported types can be expanded as needed.  It is
-regrettable that this limitation exists.  Function wrapping has proven
-difficult to implement, with a certain apparently unavoidable level of
-ickiness.  After several implementation attempts, the present
-arrangement appears to be the least-worst tradeoff.  At least it works
-reliably in the presence of dynamic linking and dynamic code
-loading/unloading.</p>
-<p>You should not attempt to wrap a function of one type signature with a
-wrapper of a different type signature.  Such trickery will surely lead
-to crashes or strange behaviour.  This is not a limitation
-of the function wrapping implementation, merely a reflection of the
-fact that it gives you sweeping powers to shoot yourself in the foot
-if you are not careful.  Imagine the instant havoc you could wreak by
-writing a wrapper which matched any function name in any soname - in
-effect, one which claimed to be a wrapper for all functions in the
-process.</p>

-<p>This chapter describes the Valgrind core services, command-line
-options and behaviours.  That means it is relevant regardless of what
-particular tool you are using.  The information should be sufficient for you
-to make effective day-to-day use of Valgrind.  Advanced topics related to
-the Valgrind core are described in <a class="xref" href="manual-core-adv.html" title="3.Using and understanding the Valgrind core: Advanced Topics">Valgrind's core: advanced topics</a>.
-</p>
-<p>
-A point of terminology: most references to "Valgrind" in this chapter
-refer to the Valgrind core services.  </p>
-<div class="sect1" title="2.1.What Valgrind does with your program">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="manual-core.whatdoes"></a>2.1.What Valgrind does with your program</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Valgrind is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible. It works
-directly with existing executables. You don't need to recompile, relink,
-or otherwise modify the program to be checked.</p>
-<p>You invoke Valgrind like this:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-valgrind [valgrind-options] your-prog [your-prog-options]</pre>
-<p>The most important option is <code class="option">--tool</code> which dictates
-which Valgrind tool to run.  For example, if want to run the command
-<code class="computeroutput">ls -l</code> using the memory-checking tool
-Memcheck, issue this command:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-valgrind --tool=memcheck ls -l</pre>
-<p>However, Memcheck is the default, so if you want to use it you can
-omit the <code class="option">--tool</code> option.</p>
-<p>Regardless of which tool is in use, Valgrind takes control of your
-program before it starts.  Debugging information is read from the
-executable and associated libraries, so that error messages and other
-outputs can be phrased in terms of source code locations, when
-appropriate.</p>
-<p>Your program is then run on a synthetic CPU provided by the
-Valgrind core.  As new code is executed for the first time, the core
-hands the code to the selected tool.  The tool adds its own
-instrumentation code to this and hands the result back to the core,
-which coordinates the continued execution of this instrumented
-code.</p>
-<p>The amount of instrumentation code added varies widely between
-tools.  At one end of the scale, Memcheck adds code to check every
-memory access and every value computed,
-making it run 10-50 times slower than natively.
-At the other end of the spectrum, the minimal tool, called Nulgrind,
-adds no instrumentation at all and causes in total "only" about a 4 times
-slowdown.</p>
-<p>Valgrind simulates every single instruction your program executes.
-Because of this, the active tool checks, or profiles, not only the code
-in your application but also in all supporting dynamically-linked libraries,
-including the C library, graphical libraries, and so on.</p>
-<p>If you're using an error-detection tool, Valgrind may
-detect errors in system libraries, for example the GNU C or X11
-libraries, which you have to use.  You might not be interested in these
-errors, since you probably have no control over that code.  Therefore,
-Valgrind allows you to selectively suppress errors, by recording them in
-a suppressions file which is read when Valgrind starts up.  The build
-mechanism selects default suppressions which give reasonable
-behaviour for the OS and libraries detected on your machine.
-To make it easier to write suppressions, you can use the
-<code class="option">--gen-suppressions=yes</code> option.  This tells Valgrind to
-print out a suppression for each reported error, which you can then
-copy into a suppressions file.</p>
-<p>Different error-checking tools report different kinds of errors.
-The suppression mechanism therefore allows you to say which tool or
-tool(s) each suppression applies to.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect1" title="2.2.Getting started">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="manual-core.started"></a>2.2.Getting started</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>First off, consider whether it might be beneficial to recompile
-your application and supporting libraries with debugging info enabled
-(the <code class="option">-g</code> option).  Without debugging info, the best
-Valgrind tools will be able to do is guess which function a particular
-piece of code belongs to, which makes both error messages and profiling
-output nearly useless.  With <code class="option">-g</code>, you'll get
-messages which point directly to the relevant source code lines.</p>
-<p>Another option you might like to consider, if you are working with
-C++, is <code class="option">-fno-inline</code>.  That makes it easier to see the
-function-call chain, which can help reduce confusion when navigating
-around large C++ apps.  For example, debugging
-OpenOffice.org with Memcheck is a bit easier when using this option.  You
-don't have to do this, but doing so helps Valgrind produce more accurate
-and less confusing error reports.  Chances are you're set up like this
-already, if you intended to debug your program with GNU GDB, or some
-other debugger.</p>
-<p>If you are planning to use Memcheck: On rare
-occasions, compiler optimisations (at <code class="option">-O2</code>
-and above, and sometimes <code class="option">-O1</code>) have been
-observed to generate code which fools Memcheck into wrongly reporting
-uninitialised value errors, or missing uninitialised value errors.  We have
-looked in detail into fixing this, and unfortunately the result is that
-doing so would give a further significant slowdown in what is already a slow
-tool.  So the best solution is to turn off optimisation altogether.  Since
-this often makes things unmanageably slow, a reasonable compromise is to use
-<code class="option">-O</code>.  This gets you the majority of the
-benefits of higher optimisation levels whilst keeping relatively small the
-chances of false positives or false negatives from Memcheck.  Also, you
-should compile your code with <code class="option">-Wall</code> because
-it can identify some or all of the problems that Valgrind can miss at the
-higher optimisation levels.  (Using <code class="option">-Wall</code>
-is also a good idea in general.)  All other tools (as far as we know) are
-unaffected by optimisation level, and for profiling tools like Cachegrind it
-is better to compile your program at its normal optimisation level.</p>
-<p>Valgrind understands both the older "stabs" debugging format, used
-by GCC versions prior to 3.1, and the newer DWARF2/3/4 formats
-used by GCC
-3.1 and later.  We continue to develop our debug-info readers,
-although the majority of effort will naturally enough go into the newer
-DWARF readers.</p>
-<p>When you're ready to roll, run Valgrind as described above.
-Note that you should run the real
-(machine-code) executable here.  If your application is started by, for
-example, a shell or Perl script, you'll need to modify it to invoke
-Valgrind on the real executables.  Running such scripts directly under
-Valgrind will result in you getting error reports pertaining to
-<code class="filename">/bin/sh</code>,
-<code class="filename">/usr/bin/perl</code>, or whatever interpreter
-you're using.  This may not be what you want and can be confusing.  You
-can force the issue by giving the option
-<code class="option">--trace-children=yes</code>, but confusion is still
-likely.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect1" title="2.3.The Commentary">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="manual-core.comment"></a>2.3.The Commentary</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Valgrind tools write a commentary, a stream of text, detailing
-error reports and other significant events.  All lines in the commentary
-have following form:
-
-</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-==12345== some-message-from-Valgrind</pre>
-<p>
-</p>
-<p>The <code class="computeroutput">12345</code> is the process ID.
-This scheme makes it easy to distinguish program output from Valgrind
-commentary, and also easy to differentiate commentaries from different
-processes which have become merged together, for whatever reason.</p>
-<p>By default, Valgrind tools write only essential messages to the
-commentary, so as to avoid flooding you with information of secondary
-importance.  If you want more information about what is happening,
-re-run, passing the <code class="option">-v</code> option to Valgrind.  A second
-<code class="option">-v</code> gives yet more detail.
-</p>
-<p>You can direct the commentary to three different places:</p>
-<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
-<li class="listitem">
-<p><a name="manual-core.out2fd"></a>The default: send it to a file descriptor, which is by default
-    2 (stderr).  So, if you give the core no options, it will write
-    commentary to the standard error stream.  If you want to send it to
-    some other file descriptor, for example number 9, you can specify
-    <code class="option">--log-fd=9</code>.</p>
-<p>This is the simplest and most common arrangement, but can
-    cause problems when Valgrinding entire trees of processes which
-    expect specific file descriptors, particularly stdin/stdout/stderr,
-    to be available for their own use.</p>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><a name="manual-core.out2file"></a>A less intrusive
-    option is to write the commentary to a file, which you specify by
-    <code class="option">--log-file=filename</code>.  There are special format
-    specifiers that can be used to use a process ID or an environment
-    variable name in the log file name.  These are useful/necessary if your
-    program invokes multiple processes (especially for MPI programs).
-    See the <a class="link" href="manual-core.html#manual-core.basicopts" title="2.6.2.Basic Options">basic options section</a>
-    for more details.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p><a name="manual-core.out2socket"></a>The
-    least intrusive option is to send the commentary to a network
-    socket.  The socket is specified as an IP address and port number
-    pair, like this: <code class="option">--log-socket=192.168.0.1:12345</code> if
-    you want to send the output to host IP 192.168.0.1 port 12345
-    (note: we
-    have no idea if 12345 is a port of pre-existing significance).  You
-    can also omit the port number:
-    <code class="option">--log-socket=192.168.0.1</code>, in which case a default
-    port of 1500 is used.  This default is defined by the constant
-    <code class="computeroutput">VG_CLO_DEFAULT_LOGPORT</code> in the
-    sources.</p>
-<p>Note, unfortunately, that you have to use an IP address here,
-    rather than a hostname.</p>
-<p>Writing to a network socket is pointless if you don't
-    have something listening at the other end.  We provide a simple
-    listener program,
-    <code class="computeroutput">valgrind-listener</code>, which accepts
-    connections on the specified port and copies whatever it is sent to
-    stdout.  Probably someone will tell us this is a horrible security
-    risk.  It seems likely that people will write more sophisticated
-    listeners in the fullness of time.</p>
-<p><code class="computeroutput">valgrind-listener</code> can accept
-    simultaneous connections from up to 50 Valgrinded processes.  In front
-    of each line of output it prints the current number of active
-    connections in round brackets.</p>
-<p><code class="computeroutput">valgrind-listener</code> accepts two
-    command-line options:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="option">-e</code> or <code class="option">--exit-at-zero</code>: 
-         when the number of connected processes falls back to zero,
-         exit.  Without this, it will run forever, that is, until you
-         send it Control-C.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="option">portnumber</code>: changes the port it listens
-        on from the default (1500).  The specified port must be in the
-        range 1024 to 65535.  The same restriction applies to port
-        numbers specified by a <code class="option">--log-socket</code> to
-        Valgrind itself.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>If a Valgrinded process fails to connect to a listener, for
-    whatever reason (the listener isn't running, invalid or unreachable
-    host or port, etc), Valgrind switches back to writing the commentary
-    to stderr.  The same goes for any process which loses an established
-    connection to a listener.  In other words, killing the listener
-    doesn't kill the processes sending data to it.</p>
-</li>
-</ol></div>
-<p>Here is an important point about the relationship between the
-commentary and profiling output from tools.  The commentary contains a
-mix of messages from the Valgrind core and the selected tool.  If the
-tool reports errors, it will report them to the commentary.  However, if
-the tool does profiling, the profile data will be written to a file of
-some kind, depending on the tool, and independent of what
-<code class="option">--log-*</code> options are in force.  The commentary is
-intended to be a low-bandwidth, human-readable channel.  Profiling data,
-on the other hand, is usually voluminous and not meaningful without
-further processing, which is why we have chosen this arrangement.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect1" title="2.4.Reporting of errors">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="manual-core.report"></a>2.4.Reporting of errors</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>When an error-checking tool
-detects something bad happening in the program, an error
-message is written to the commentary.  Here's an example from Memcheck:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-==25832== Invalid read of size 4
-==25832==    at 0x8048724: BandMatrix::ReSize(int, int, int) (bogon.cpp:45)
-==25832==    by 0x80487AF: main (bogon.cpp:66)
-==25832==  Address 0xBFFFF74C is not stack'd, malloc'd or free'd</pre>
-<p>This message says that the program did an illegal 4-byte read of
-address 0xBFFFF74C, which, as far as Memcheck can tell, is not a valid
-stack address, nor corresponds to any current heap blocks or recently freed
-heap blocks.  The read is happening at line 45 of
-<code class="filename">bogon.cpp</code>, called from line 66 of the same file,
-etc.  For errors associated with an identified (current or freed) heap block,
-for example reading freed memory, Valgrind reports not only the
-location where the error happened, but also where the associated heap block
-was allocated/freed.</p>
-<p>Valgrind remembers all error reports.  When an error is detected,
-it is compared against old reports, to see if it is a duplicate.  If so,
-the error is noted, but no further commentary is emitted.  This avoids
-you being swamped with bazillions of duplicate error reports.</p>
-<p>If you want to know how many times each error occurred, run with
-the <code class="option">-v</code> option.  When execution finishes, all the
-reports are printed out, along with, and sorted by, their occurrence
-counts.  This makes it easy to see which errors have occurred most
-frequently.</p>
-<p>Errors are reported before the associated operation actually
-happens.  For example, if you're using Memcheck and your program attempts to
-read from address zero, Memcheck will emit a message to this effect, and
-your program will then likely die with a segmentation fault.</p>
-<p>In general, you should try and fix errors in the order that they
-are reported.  Not doing so can be confusing.  For example, a program
-which copies uninitialised values to several memory locations, and later
-uses them, will generate several error messages, when run on Memcheck.
-The first such error message may well give the most direct clue to the
-root cause of the problem.</p>
-<p>The process of detecting duplicate errors is quite an
-expensive one and can become a significant performance overhead
-if your program generates huge quantities of errors.  To avoid
-serious problems, Valgrind will simply stop collecting
-errors after 1,000 different errors have been seen, or 10,000,000 errors
-in total have been seen.  In this situation you might as well
-stop your program and fix it, because Valgrind won't tell you
-anything else useful after this.  Note that the 1,000/10,000,000 limits
-apply after suppressed errors are removed.  These limits are
-defined in <code class="filename">m_errormgr.c</code> and can be increased
-if necessary.</p>
-<p>To avoid this cutoff you can use the
-<code class="option">--error-limit=no</code> option.  Then Valgrind will always show
-errors, regardless of how many there are.  Use this option carefully,
-since it may have a bad effect on performance.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect1" title="2.5.Suppressing errors">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="manual-core.suppress"></a>2.5.Suppressing errors</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>The error-checking tools detect numerous problems in the system
-libraries, such as the C library, 
-which come pre-installed with your OS.  You can't easily fix
-these, but you don't want to see these errors (and yes, there are many!)
-So Valgrind reads a list of errors to suppress at startup.  A default
-suppression file is created by the
-<code class="computeroutput">./configure</code> script when the system is
-built.</p>
-<p>You can modify and add to the suppressions file at your leisure,
-or, better, write your own.  Multiple suppression files are allowed.
-This is useful if part of your project contains errors you can't or
-don't want to fix, yet you don't want to continuously be reminded of
-them.</p>
-<p title="Note:"><b>Note:</b>By far the easiest way to add
-suppressions is to use the <code class="option">--gen-suppressions=yes</code> option
-described in <a class="xref" href="manual-core.html#manual-core.options" title="2.6.Core Command-line Options">Core Command-line Options</a>.  This generates
-suppressions automatically.  For best results,
-though, you may want to edit the output
-    of  <code class="option">--gen-suppressions=yes</code> by hand, in which
-case it would be advisable to read through this section.
-</p>
-<p>Each error to be suppressed is described very specifically, to
-minimise the possibility that a suppression-directive inadvertently
-suppresses a bunch of similar errors which you did want to see.  The
-suppression mechanism is designed to allow precise yet flexible
-specification of errors to suppress.</p>
-<p>If you use the <code class="option">-v</code> option, at the end of execution,
-Valgrind prints out one line for each used suppression, giving its name
-and the number of times it got used.  Here's the suppressions used by a
-run of <code class="computeroutput">valgrind --tool=memcheck ls -l</code>:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
---27579-- supp: 1 socketcall.connect(serv_addr)/__libc_connect/__nscd_getgrgid_r
---27579-- supp: 1 socketcall.connect(serv_addr)/__libc_connect/__nscd_getpwuid_r
---27579-- supp: 6 strrchr/_dl_map_object_from_fd/_dl_map_object</pre>
-<p>Multiple suppressions files are allowed.  By default, Valgrind
-uses <code class="filename">$PREFIX/lib/valgrind/default.supp</code>.  You can
-ask to add suppressions from another file, by specifying
-<code class="option">--suppressions=/path/to/file.supp</code>.
-</p>
-<p>If you want to understand more about suppressions, look at an
-existing suppressions file whilst reading the following documentation.
-The file <code class="filename">glibc-2.3.supp</code>, in the source
-distribution, provides some good examples.</p>
-<p>Each suppression has the following components:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>First line: its name.  This merely gives a handy name to the
-    suppression, by which it is referred to in the summary of used
-    suppressions printed out when a program finishes.  It's not
-    important what the name is; any identifying string will do.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Second line: name of the tool(s) that the suppression is for
-    (if more than one, comma-separated), and the name of the suppression
-    itself, separated by a colon (n.b.: no spaces are allowed), eg:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-tool_name1,tool_name2:suppression_name</pre>
-<p>Recall that Valgrind is a modular system, in which
-    different instrumentation tools can observe your program whilst it
-    is running.  Since different tools detect different kinds of errors,
-    it is necessary to say which tool(s) the suppression is meaningful
-    to.</p>
-<p>Tools will complain, at startup, if a tool does not understand
-    any suppression directed to it.  Tools ignore suppressions which are
-    not directed to them.  As a result, it is quite practical to put
-    suppressions for all tools into the same suppression file.</p>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Next line: a small number of suppression types have extra
-    information after the second line (eg. the <code class="varname">Param</code>
-    suppression for Memcheck)</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Remaining lines: This is the calling context for the error --
-    the chain of function calls that led to it.  There can be up to 24
-    of these lines.</p>
-<p>Locations may be names of either shared objects or
-    functions.  They begin
-    <code class="computeroutput">obj:</code> and
-    <code class="computeroutput">fun:</code> respectively.  Function and
-    object names to match against may use the wildcard characters
-    <code class="computeroutput">*</code> and
-    <code class="computeroutput">?</code>.</p>
-<p><span class="command"><strong>Important note: </strong></span> C++ function names must be
-    <span class="command"><strong>mangled</strong></span>.  If you are writing suppressions by
-    hand, use the <code class="option">--demangle=no</code> option to get the
-    mangled names in your error messages.  An example of a mangled
-    C++ name is  <code class="computeroutput">_ZN9QListView4showEv</code>.
-    This is the form that the GNU C++ compiler uses internally, and
-    the form that must be used in suppression files.  The equivalent
-    demangled name, <code class="computeroutput">QListView::show()</code>,
-    is what you see at the C++ source code level.
-    </p>
-<p>A location line may also be
-    simply "<code class="computeroutput">...</code>" (three dots).  This is
-    a frame-level wildcard, which matches zero or more frames.  Frame
-    level wildcards are useful because they make it easy to ignore
-    varying numbers of uninteresting frames in between frames of
-    interest.  That is often important when writing suppressions which
-    are intended to be robust against variations in the amount of
-    function inlining done by compilers.</p>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Finally, the entire suppression must be between curly
-    braces. Each brace must be the first character on its own
-    line.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>A suppression only suppresses an error when the error matches all
-the details in the suppression.  Here's an example:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-{
-  __gconv_transform_ascii_internal/__mbrtowc/mbtowc
-  Memcheck:Value4
-  fun:__gconv_transform_ascii_internal
-  fun:__mbr*toc
-  fun:mbtowc
-}</pre>
-<p>What it means is: for Memcheck only, suppress a
-use-of-uninitialised-value error, when the data size is 4, when it
-occurs in the function
-<code class="computeroutput">__gconv_transform_ascii_internal</code>, when
-that is called from any function of name matching
-<code class="computeroutput">__mbr*toc</code>, when that is called from
-<code class="computeroutput">mbtowc</code>.  It doesn't apply under any
-other circumstances.  The string by which this suppression is identified
-to the user is
-<code class="computeroutput">__gconv_transform_ascii_internal/__mbrtowc/mbtowc</code>.</p>
-<p>(See <a class="xref" href="mc-manual.html#mc-manual.suppfiles" title="4.4.Writing suppression files">Writing suppression files</a> for more details
-on the specifics of Memcheck's suppression kinds.)</p>
-<p>Another example, again for the Memcheck tool:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-{
-  libX11.so.6.2/libX11.so.6.2/libXaw.so.7.0
-  Memcheck:Value4
-  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.2
-  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.2
-  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libXaw.so.7.0
-}</pre>
-<p>This suppresses any size 4 uninitialised-value error which occurs
-anywhere in <code class="filename">libX11.so.6.2</code>, when called from
-anywhere in the same library, when called from anywhere in
-<code class="filename">libXaw.so.7.0</code>.  The inexact specification of
-locations is regrettable, but is about all you can hope for, given that
-the X11 libraries shipped on the Linux distro on which this example
-was made have had their symbol tables removed.</p>
-<p>Although the above two examples do not make this clear, you can
-freely mix <code class="computeroutput">obj:</code> and
-<code class="computeroutput">fun:</code> lines in a suppression.</p>
-<p>Finally, here's an example using three frame-level wildcards:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-{
-   a-contrived-example
-   Memcheck:Leak
-   fun:malloc
-   ...
-   fun:ddd
-   ...
-   fun:ccc
-   ...
-   fun:main
-}
-</pre>
-This suppresses Memcheck memory-leak errors, in the case where
-the allocation was done by <code class="computeroutput">main</code>
-calling (though any number of intermediaries, including zero)
-<code class="computeroutput">ccc</code>,
-calling onwards via
-<code class="computeroutput">ddd</code> and eventually
-to <code class="computeroutput">malloc.</code>.

-<p>When enabled, the important parts of the output (e.g. tool error
-      messages) will be in XML format rather than plain text.  Furthermore,
-      the XML output will be sent to a different output channel than the
-      plain text output.  Therefore, you also must use one of
-      <code class="option">--xml-fd</code>, <code class="option">--xml-file</code> or
-      <code class="option">--xml-socket</code> to specify where the XML is to be sent.
-      </p>
-<p>Less important messages will still be printed in plain text, but
-      because the XML output and plain text output are sent to different
-      output channels (the destination of the plain text output is still
-      controlled by <code class="option">--log-fd</code>, <code class="option">--log-file</code>
-      and <code class="option">--log-socket</code>) this should not cause problems.
-      </p>
-<p>This option is aimed at making life easier for tools that consume
-      Valgrind's output as input, such as GUI front ends.  Currently this
-      option works with Memcheck, Helgrind, DRD and SGcheck.  The output
-      format is specified in the file
-      <code class="computeroutput">docs/internals/xml-output-protocol4.txt</code>
-      in the source tree for Valgrind 3.5.0 or later.</p>
-<p>The recommended options for a GUI to pass, when requesting
-      XML output, are: <code class="option">--xml=yes</code> to enable XML output,
-      <code class="option">--xml-file</code> to send the XML output to a (presumably
-      GUI-selected) file, <code class="option">--log-file</code> to send the plain
-      text output to a second GUI-selected file,
-      <code class="option">--child-silent-after-fork=yes</code>, and
-      <code class="option">-q</code> to restrict the plain text output to critical
-      error messages created by Valgrind itself.  For example, failure to
-      read a specified suppressions file counts as a critical error message.
-      In this way, for a successful run the text output file will be empty.
-      But if it isn't empty, then it will contain important information
-      which the GUI user should be made aware
-      of.</p>

-<dd>
-<p>By default Valgrind only shows the filenames in stack
-      traces, but not full paths to source files.  When using Valgrind
-      in large projects where the sources reside in multiple different
-      directories, this can be inconvenient.
-      <code class="option">--fullpath-after</code> provides a flexible solution
-      to this problem.  When this option is present, the path to each
-      source file is shown, with the following all-important caveat:
-      if <code class="option">string</code> is found in the path, then the path
-      up to and including <code class="option">string</code> is omitted, else the
-      path is shown unmodified.  Note that <code class="option">string</code> is
-      not required to be a prefix of the path.</p>
-<p>For example, consider a file named
-      <code class="computeroutput">/home/janedoe/blah/src/foo/bar/xyzzy.c</code>.
-      Specifying <code class="option">--fullpath-after=/home/janedoe/blah/src/</code>
-      will cause Valgrind to show the name
-      as <code class="computeroutput">foo/bar/xyzzy.c</code>.</p>
-<p>Because the string is not required to be a prefix,
-      <code class="option">--fullpath-after=src/</code> will produce the same
-      output.  This is useful when the path contains arbitrary
-      machine-generated characters.  For example, the
-      path
-      <code class="computeroutput">/my/build/dir/C32A1B47/blah/src/foo/xyzzy</code>
-      can be pruned to <code class="computeroutput">foo/xyzzy</code>
-      using
-      <code class="option">--fullpath-after=/blah/src/</code>.</p>
-<p>If you simply want to see the full path, just specify an
-      empty string: <code class="option">--fullpath-after=</code>.  This isn't a
-      special case, merely a logical consequence of the above rules.</p>
-<p>Finally, you can use <code class="option">--fullpath-after</code>
-      multiple times.  Any appearance of it causes Valgrind to switch
-      to producing full paths and applying the above filtering rule.
-      Each produced path is compared against all
-      the <code class="option">--fullpath-after</code>-specified strings, in the
-      order specified.  The first string to match causes the path to
-      be truncated as described above.  If none match, the full path
-      is shown.  This facilitates chopping off prefixes when the
-      sources are drawn from a number of unrelated directories.

-<p>When set to <code class="varname">all</code>, Valgrind will print a
-      suppression for every reported error, without querying the
-      user.</p>
-<p>This option is particularly useful with C++ programs, as it
-      prints out the suppressions with mangled names, as
-      required.</p>
-<p>Note that the suppressions printed are as specific as
-      possible.  You may want to common up similar ones, by adding
-      wildcards to function names, and by using frame-level wildcards.
-      The wildcarding facilities are powerful yet flexible, and with a
-      bit of careful editing, you may be able to suppress a whole
-      family of related errors with only a few suppressions.

-<p>Sometimes two different errors

-      subsequently report large numbers of invalid stack accesses.  This
-      option allows you to change the threshold to a different
-      value.</p>
-<p>You should only consider use of this option if Valgrind's
-      debug output directs you to do so.  In that case it will tell you
-      the new threshold you should specify.</p>
-<p>In general, allocating large structures on the stack is a
-      bad idea, because you can easily run out of stack space,
-      especially on systems with limited memory or which expect to
-      support large numbers of threads each with a small stack, and also
-      because the error checking performed by Memcheck is more effective
-      for heap-allocated data than for stack-allocated data.  If you
-      have to use this option, you may wish to consider rewriting your
-      code to allocate on the heap rather than on the stack.</p>

-<p>Specifies the size of the main thread's stack.</p>
-<p>To simplify its memory management, Valgrind reserves all
-      required space for the main thread's stack at startup.  That
-      means it needs to know the required stack size at
-      startup.</p>
-<p>By default, Valgrind uses the current "ulimit" value for
-      the stack size, or 16 MB, whichever is lower.  In many cases
-      this gives a stack size in the range 8 to 16 MB, which almost
-      never overflows for most applications.</p>
-<p>If you need a larger total stack size,
-      use <code class="option">--main-stacksize</code> to specify it.  Only set
-      it as high as you need, since reserving far more space than you
-      need (that is, hundreds of megabytes more than you need)
-      constrains Valgrind's memory allocators and may reduce the total
-      amount of memory that Valgrind can use.  This is only really of
-      significance on 32-bit machines.</p>
-<p>On Linux, you may request a stack of size up to 2GB.
-      Valgrind will stop with a diagnostic message if the stack cannot
-      be allocated.</p>
-<p><code class="option">--main-stacksize</code> only affects the stack
-      size for the program's initial thread.  It has no bearing on the
-      size of thread stacks, as Valgrind does not allocate
-      those.</p>
-<p>You may need to use both <code class="option">--main-stacksize</code>
-      and <code class="option">--max-stackframe</code> together.  It is important
-      to understand that <code class="option">--main-stacksize</code> sets the
-      maximum total stack size,
-      whilst <code class="option">--max-stackframe</code> specifies the largest
-      size of any one stack frame.  You will have to work out
-      the <code class="option">--main-stacksize</code> value for yourself
-      (usually, if your applications segfaults).  But Valgrind will
-      tell you the needed <code class="option">--max-stackframe</code> size, if
-      necessary.</p>
-<p>As discussed further in the description
-      of <code class="option">--max-stackframe</code>, a requirement for a large
-      stack is a sign of potential portability problems.  You are best
-      advised to place all large data in heap-allocated memory.</p>

-<p> Valgrind's <code class="function">malloc, realloc,</code> etc, add
-      padding blocks before and after each heap block allocated by the
-      program being run. Such padding blocks are called redzones.  The
-      default value for the redzone size depends on the tool.  For
-      example, Memcheck adds and protects a minimum of 16 bytes before

-      </p>
-<p>Increasing the redzone size makes it possible to detect

-<p>This option controls Valgrind's detection of self-modifying
-      code.  If no checking is done, if a program executes some code, then
-      overwrites it with new code, and executes the new code, Valgrind will
-      continue to execute the translations it made for the old code.  This
-      will likely lead to incorrect behaviour and/or crashes.</p>
-<p>Valgrind has four levels of self-modifying code detection:
-      no detection, detect self-modifying code on the stack (which is used by
-      GCC to implement nested functions), detect self-modifying code
-      everywhere, and detect self-modifying code everywhere except in
-      file-backed mappings.
-
-      Note that the default option will catch the vast majority
-      of cases.  The main case it will not catch is programs such as JIT
-      compilers that dynamically generate code <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
-      subsequently overwrite part or all of it.  Running with
-      <code class="varname">all</code> will slow Valgrind down noticeably.
-      Running with
-      <code class="varname">none</code> will rarely speed things up, since very little
-      code gets put on the stack for most programs.  The
-      <code class="function">VALGRIND_DISCARD_TRANSLATIONS</code> client
-      request is an alternative to <code class="option">--smc-check=all</code>
-      that requires more programmer effort but allows Valgrind to run
-      your program faster, by telling it precisely when translations
-      need to be re-made.
-      
-      </p>
-<p><code class="option">--smc-check=all-non-file</code> provides a
-      cheaper but more limited version
-      of <code class="option">--smc-check=all</code>.  It adds checks to any
-      translations that do not originate from file-backed memory
-      mappings.  Typical applications that generate code, for example
-      JITs in web browsers, generate code into anonymous mmaped areas,
-      whereas the "fixed" code of the browser always lives in
-      file-backed mappings.  <code class="option">--smc-check=all-non-file</code>
-      takes advantage of this observation, limiting the overhead of
-      checking to code which is likely to be JIT generated.</p>
-<p>Some architectures (including ppc32, ppc64, ARM and MIPS)
-      require programs which create code at runtime to flush the
-      instruction cache in between code generation and first use.
-      Valgrind observes and honours such instructions.  Hence, on
-      ppc32/Linux, ppc64/Linux and ARM/Linux, Valgrind always provides
-      complete, transparent support for self-modifying code.  It is
-      only on platforms such as x86/Linux, AMD64/Linux, x86/Darwin and

-<p>This option is only relevant when running Valgrind on Linux.</p>
-<p>The GNU C library (<code class="function">libc.so</code>), which is
-      used by all programs, may allocate memory for its own uses.
-      Usually it doesn't bother to free that memory when the program
-      ends&#8212;there would be no point, since the Linux kernel reclaims
-      all process resources when a process exits anyway, so it would
-      just slow things down.</p>
-<p>The glibc authors realised that this behaviour causes leak
-      checkers, such as Valgrind, to falsely report leaks in glibc, when
-      a leak check is done at exit.  In order to avoid this, they
-      provided a routine called <code class="function">__libc_freeres</code>
-      specifically to make glibc release all memory it has allocated.
-      Memcheck therefore tries to run
-      <code class="function">__libc_freeres</code> at exit.</p>
-<p>Unfortunately, in some very old versions of glibc,
-      <code class="function">__libc_freeres</code> is sufficiently buggy to cause
-      segmentation faults.  This was particularly noticeable on Red Hat
-      7.1.  So this option is provided in order to inhibit the run of

-<p>When a shared library is loaded, Valgrind checks for 
-      functions in the library that must be replaced or wrapped.
-      For example, Memcheck replaces all malloc related
-      functions (malloc, free, calloc, ...) with its own versions.
-      Such replacements are done by default only in shared libraries whose
-      soname matches a predefined soname pattern (e.g.
-      <code class="varname">libc.so*</code> on linux).
-      By default, no replacement is done for a statically linked
-      library or for alternative libraries such as tcmalloc.
-      In some cases, the replacements allow
-      <code class="option">--soname-synonyms</code> to specify one additional
-      synonym pattern, giving flexibility in the replacement. </p>
-<p>Currently, this flexibility is only allowed for the
-      malloc related functions, using the
-      synonym <code class="varname">somalloc</code>.  This synonym is usable for
-      all tools doing standard replacement of malloc related functions
-      (e.g. memcheck, massif, drd, helgrind, exp-dhat, exp-sgcheck).

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="manual-core.pthreads"></a>2.7.Support for Threads</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Threaded programs are fully supported.</p>
-<p>The main thing to point out with respect to threaded programs is
-that your program will use the native threading library, but Valgrind
-serialises execution so that only one (kernel) thread is running at a
-time.  This approach avoids the horrible implementation problems of
-implementing a truly multithreaded version of Valgrind, but it does
-mean that threaded apps never use more than one CPU simultaneously,
-even if you have a multiprocessor or multicore machine.</p>
-<p>Valgrind doesn't schedule the threads itself.  It merely ensures
-that only one thread runs at once, using a simple locking scheme.  The
-actual thread scheduling remains under control of the OS kernel.  What
-this does mean, though, is that your program will see very different
-scheduling when run on Valgrind than it does when running normally.
-This is both because Valgrind is serialising the threads, and because
-the code runs so much slower than normal.</p>
-<p>This difference in scheduling may cause your program to behave
-differently, if you have some kind of concurrency, critical race,
-locking, or similar, bugs.  In that case you might consider using the
-tools Helgrind and/or DRD to track them down.</p>
-<p>On Linux, Valgrind also supports direct use of the
-<code class="computeroutput">clone</code> system call,
-<code class="computeroutput">futex</code> and so on.
-<code class="computeroutput">clone</code> is supported where either
-everything is shared (a thread) or nothing is shared (fork-like); partial
-sharing will fail.
-</p>
-<div class="sect2" title="2.7.1.Scheduling and Multi-Thread Performance">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-core.pthreads_perf_sched"></a>2.7.1.Scheduling and Multi-Thread Performance</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>A thread executes code only when it holds the abovementioned
-lock.  After executing some number of instructions, the running thread
-will release the lock.  All threads ready to run will then compete to
-acquire the lock.</p>
-<p>The <code class="option">--fair-sched</code> option controls the locking mechanism
-used to serialise thread execution.</p>
-<p>The default pipe based locking mechanism
-(<code class="option">--fair-sched=no</code>) is available on all
-platforms.  Pipe based locking does not guarantee fairness between
-threads: it is quite likely that a thread that has just released the
-lock reacquires it immediately, even though other threads are ready to
-run.  When using pipe based locking, different runs of the same
-multithreaded application might give very different thread
-scheduling.</p>
-<p>An alternative locking mechanism, based on futexes, is available
-on some platforms.  If available, it is activated
-by <code class="option">--fair-sched=yes</code> or
-<code class="option">--fair-sched=try</code>.  Futex based locking ensures
-fairness (round-robin scheduling) between threads: if multiple threads
-are ready to run, the lock will be given to the thread which first
-requested the lock.  Note that a thread which is blocked in a system
-call (e.g. in a blocking read system call) has not (yet) requested the
-lock: such a thread requests the lock only after the system call is
-finished.</p>
-<p> The fairness of the futex based locking produces better
-reproducibility of thread scheduling for different executions of a
-multithreaded application. This better reproducibility is particularly
-helpful when using Helgrind or DRD.</p>
-<p>Valgrind's use of thread serialisation implies that only one
-thread at a time may run.  On a multiprocessor/multicore system, the
-running thread is assigned to one of the CPUs by the OS kernel
-scheduler.  When a thread acquires the lock, sometimes the thread will
-be assigned to the same CPU as the thread that just released the
-lock.  Sometimes, the thread will be assigned to another CPU.  When
-using pipe based locking, the thread that just acquired the lock
-will usually be scheduled on the same CPU as the thread that just
-released the lock.  With the futex based mechanism, the thread that
-just acquired the lock will more often be scheduled on another
-CPU.</p>
-<p>Valgrind's thread serialisation and CPU assignment by the OS
-kernel scheduler can interact badly with the CPU frequency scaling
-available on many modern CPUs.  To decrease power consumption, the
-frequency of a CPU or core is automatically decreased if the CPU/core
-has not been used recently.  If the OS kernel often assigns the thread
-which just acquired the lock to another CPU/core, it is quite likely
-that this CPU/core is currently at a low frequency.  The frequency of
-this CPU will be increased after some time.  However, during this
-time, the (only) running thread will have run at the low frequency.
-Once this thread has run for some time, it will release the lock.
-Another thread will acquire this lock, and might be scheduled again on
-another CPU whose clock frequency was decreased in the
-meantime.</p>
-<p>The futex based locking causes threads to change CPUs/cores more
-often.  So, if CPU frequency scaling is activated, the futex based
-locking might decrease significantly the performance of a
-multithreaded app running under Valgrind.  Performance losses of up to
-50% degradation have been observed, as compared to running on a
-machine for which CPU frequency scaling has been disabled.  The pipe
-based locking locking scheme also interacts badly with CPU frequency
-scaling, with performance losses in the range 10..20% having been
-observed.</p>
-<p>To avoid such performance degradation, you should indicate to
-the kernel that all CPUs/cores should always run at maximum clock
-speed.  Depending on your Linux distribution, CPU frequency scaling
-may be controlled using a graphical interface or using command line
-such as
-<code class="computeroutput">cpufreq-selector</code> or
-<code class="computeroutput">cpufreq-set</code>.
-</p>
-<p>An alternative way to avoid these problems is to tell the
-OS scheduler to tie a Valgrind process to a specific (fixed) CPU using the
-<code class="computeroutput">taskset</code> command.  This should ensure
-that the selected CPU does not fall below its maximum frequency
-setting so long as any thread of the program has work to do.

-<p>Valgrind has a fairly complete signal implementation.  It should be
-able to cope with any POSIX-compliant use of signals.</p>
-<p>If you're using signals in clever ways (for example, catching
-SIGSEGV, modifying page state and restarting the instruction), you're

-or <code class="option">--vex-iropt-register-updates=allregs-at-each-insn</code>.
-</p>
-<p>If your program dies as a result of a fatal core-dumping signal,
-Valgrind will generate its own core file
-(<code class="computeroutput">vgcore.NNNNN</code>) containing your program's
-state.  You may use this core file for post-mortem debugging with GDB or
-similar.  (Note: it will not generate a core if your core dump size limit is
-0.)  At the time of writing the core dumps do not include all the floating
-point register information.</p>
-<p>In the unlikely event that Valgrind itself crashes, the operating system
-will create a core dump in the usual way.</p>

-<li class="listitem"><p>Memory consumption of your program is majorly increased

-<p>Valgrind can handle dynamically-generated code just fine.  If

-   use the <code class="option">--smc-check=all</code> option, and Valgrind will

-   </p>
-<p> On other platforms (ARM, PowerPC) Valgrind observes and

-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Valgrind has the following limitations
-   in its implementation of x86/AMD64 floating point relative to 
-   IEEE754.</p>
-<p>Precision: There is no support for 80 bit arithmetic.
-   Internally, Valgrind represents all such "long double" numbers in 64
-   bits, and so there may be some differences in results.  Whether or
-   not this is critical remains to be seen.  Note, the x86/amd64
-   fldt/fstpt instructions (read/write 80-bit numbers) are correctly
-   simulated, using conversions to/from 64 bits, so that in-memory
-   images of 80-bit numbers look correct if anyone wants to see.</p>
-<p>The impression observed from many FP regression tests is that
-   the accuracy differences aren't significant.  Generally speaking, if
-   a program relies on 80-bit precision, there may be difficulties
-   porting it to non x86/amd64 platforms which only support 64-bit FP
-   precision.  Even on x86/amd64, the program may get different results
-   depending on whether it is compiled to use SSE2 instructions (64-bits
-   only), or x87 instructions (80-bit).  The net effect is to make FP
-   programs behave as if they had been run on a machine with 64-bit IEEE
-   floats, for example PowerPC.  On amd64 FP arithmetic is done by
-   default on SSE2, so amd64 looks more like PowerPC than x86 from an FP
-   perspective, and there are far fewer noticeable accuracy differences
-   than with x86.</p>
-<p>Rounding: Valgrind does observe the 4 IEEE-mandated rounding
-   modes (to nearest, to +infinity, to -infinity, to zero) for the
-   following conversions: float to integer, integer to float where
-   there is a possibility of loss of precision, and float-to-float
-   rounding.  For all other FP operations, only the IEEE default mode
-   (round to nearest) is supported.</p>
-<p>Numeric exceptions in FP code: IEEE754 defines five types of
-   numeric exception that can happen: invalid operation (sqrt of
-   negative number, etc), division by zero, overflow, underflow,
-   inexact (loss of precision).</p>
-<p>For each exception, two courses of action are defined by IEEE754:
-   either (1) a user-defined exception handler may be called, or (2) a
-   default action is defined, which "fixes things up" and allows the
-   computation to proceed without throwing an exception.</p>
-<p>Currently Valgrind only supports the default fixup actions.
-   Again, feedback on the importance of exception support would be
-   appreciated.</p>
-<p>When Valgrind detects that the program is trying to exceed any
-   of these limitations (setting exception handlers, rounding mode, or
-   precision control), it can print a message giving a traceback of
-   where this has happened, and continue execution.  This behaviour used
-   to be the default, but the messages are annoying and so showing them
-   is now disabled by default.  Use <code class="option">--show-emwarns=yes</code> to see
-   them.</p>
-<p>The above limitations define precisely the IEEE754 'default'
-   behaviour: default fixup on all exceptions, round-to-nearest
-   operations, and 64-bit precision.</p>

-   all floating point instructions, except for "fre" and "fres", which are
-   done more precisely than required by the PowerPC architecture specification.
-   All floating point operations observe the current rounding mode.
-   </p>
-<p>However, fpscr[FPRF] is not set after each operation.  That could
-   be done but would give measurable performance overheads, and so far
-   no need for it has been found.</p>
-<p>As on x86/AMD64, IEEE754 exceptions are not supported: all floating
-   point exceptions are handled using the default IEEE fixup actions.
-   Valgrind detects, ignores, and can warn about, attempts to unmask 
-   the 5 IEEE FP exception kinds by writing to the floating-point status 
-   and control register (fpscr).
-   </p>
-<p>Vector (Altivec, VMX): essentially as with x86/AMD64 SSE/SSE2: 
-   no exceptions, and limited observance of rounding mode.  
-   For Altivec, FP arithmetic
-   is done in IEEE/Java mode, which is more accurate than the Linux default
-   setting.  "More accurate" means that denormals are handled properly, 
-   rather than simply being flushed to zero.</p>

-<p>After 100 different errors have been shown, Valgrind becomes
-    more conservative about collecting them.  It then requires only the
-    program counters in the top two stack frames to match when deciding
-    whether or not two errors are really the same one.  Prior to this
-    point, the PCs in the top four frames are required to match.  This

-<p>After 1000 different errors have been detected, Valgrind
-    ignores any more.  It seems unlikely that collecting even more

-    base of the new stack is, and sets memory permissions accordingly.
-    You may get many bogus error messages following this, if Valgrind

-<p>Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis
-tools.  It comes with a set of tools each of which performs some kind of
-debugging, profiling, or similar task that helps you improve your programs.
-Valgrind's architecture is modular, so new tools can be created easily
-and without disturbing the existing structure.</p>
-<p>A number of useful tools are supplied as standard.</p>
-<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
-<li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>Memcheck</strong></span> is a memory error detector.  It helps
-    you make your programs, particularly those written in C and C++, more
-    correct.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>Cachegrind</strong></span> is a cache and branch-prediction
-    profiler.  It helps you make your programs run faster.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>Callgrind</strong></span> is a call-graph generating cache
-    profiler.  It has some overlap with Cachegrind, but also gathers some
-    information that Cachegrind does not.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>Helgrind</strong></span> is a thread error detector.
-    It helps you make your multi-threaded programs more correct.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>DRD</strong></span> is also a thread error detector.  It is
-    similar to Helgrind but uses different analysis techniques and so may
-    find different problems.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>Massif</strong></span> is a heap profiler.  It helps you
-    make your programs use less memory.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>DHAT</strong></span> is a different kind of heap
-    profiler.  It helps you understand issues of block lifetimes,
-    block utilisation, and layout inefficiencies.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>SGcheck</strong></span> is an experimental tool that can
-    detect overruns of stack and global arrays.  Its functionality is
-    complementary to that of Memcheck: SGcheck finds problems that
-    Memcheck can't, and vice versa..</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><span class="command"><strong>BBV</strong></span> is an experimental SimPoint basic block
-    vector generator.  It is useful to people doing computer architecture
-    research and development.</p></li>
-</ol></div>
-<p>There are also a couple of minor tools that aren't useful to
-most users:  <span class="command"><strong>Lackey</strong></span> is an example tool that illustrates
-some instrumentation basics; and <span class="command"><strong>Nulgrind</strong></span> is the minimal
-Valgrind tool that does no analysis or instrumentation, and is only useful
-for testing purposes.</p>
-<p>Valgrind is closely tied to details of the CPU and operating
-system, and to a lesser extent, the compiler and basic C libraries.
-Nonetheless, it supports a number of widely-used platforms, listed in full
-at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.valgrind.org/" target="_top">http://www.valgrind.org/</a>.</p>
-<p>Valgrind is built via the standard Unix
-<code class="computeroutput">./configure</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">make</code>, <code class="computeroutput">make
-install</code> process;  full details are given in the
-README file in the distribution.</p>
-<p>Valgrind is licensed under the <a class="xref" href="license.gpl.html" title="1.The GNU General Public License"> The GNU General Public License</a>,
-version 2.  The <code class="computeroutput">valgrind/*.h</code> headers
-that you may wish to include in your code (eg.
-<code class="filename">valgrind.h</code>, <code class="filename">memcheck.h</code>,
-<code class="filename">helgrind.h</code>, etc.) are
-distributed under a BSD-style license, so you may include them in your

-<p>This manual's structure reflects the structure of Valgrind itself.
-First, we describe the Valgrind core, how to use it, and the options
-it supports.  Then, each tool has its own chapter in this manual.  You
-only need to read the documentation for the core and for the tool(s) you
-actually use, although you may find it helpful to be at least a little
-bit familiar with what all tools do.  If you're new to all this, you probably
-want to run the Memcheck tool and you might find the <a class="xref" href="quick-start.html" title="The Valgrind Quick Start Guide">The Valgrind Quick Start Guide</a> useful.</p>
-<p>Be aware that the core understands some command line options, and
-the tools have their own options which they know about.  This means
-there is no central place describing all the options that are
-accepted -- you have to read the options documentation both for

-So you want to write a Valgrind tool?  Here are some instructions that may
-help.
-
-<div class="sect1" title="2.1.Introduction">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.intro"></a>2.1.Introduction</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>The key idea behind Valgrind's architecture is the division
-between its <span class="emphasis"><em>core</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>tools</em></span>.</p>
-<p>The core provides the common low-level infrastructure to
-support program instrumentation, including the JIT
-compiler, low-level memory manager, signal handling and a
-thread scheduler.  It also provides certain services that
-are useful to some but not all tools, such as support for error
-recording, and support for replacing heap allocation functions such as
-<code class="function">malloc</code>.</p>
-<p>But the core leaves certain operations undefined, which
-must be filled by tools.  Most notably, tools define how program
-code should be instrumented.  They can also call certain
-functions to indicate to the core that they would like to use
-certain services, or be notified when certain interesting events
-occur.  But the core takes care of all the hard work.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect1" title="2.2.Basics">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.writingatool"></a>2.2.Basics</h2></div></div></div>
-<div class="sect2" title="2.2.1.How tools work">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.howtoolswork"></a>2.2.1.How tools work</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Tools must define various functions for instrumenting programs
-that are called by Valgrind's core. They are then linked against
-Valgrind's core to define a complete Valgrind tool which will be used
-when the <code class="option">--tool</code> option is used to select it.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="2.2.2.Getting the code">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.gettingcode"></a>2.2.2.Getting the code</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>To write your own tool, you'll need the Valgrind source code.  You'll
-need a check-out of the Subversion repository for the automake/autoconf
-build instructions to work.  See the information about how to do check-out
-from the repository at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.valgrind.org/downloads/repository.html" target="_top">the Valgrind
-website</a>.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="2.2.3.Getting started">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.gettingstarted"></a>2.2.3.Getting started</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Valgrind uses GNU <code class="computeroutput">automake</code> and

-<div class="sect2" title="2.2.4.Writing the code">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.writingcode"></a>2.2.4.Writing the code</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>A tool must define at least these four functions:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-  pre_clo_init()
-  post_clo_init()
-  instrument()
-  fini()</pre>
-<p>The names can be different to the above, but these are the usual
-names.  The first one is registered using the macro
-<code class="computeroutput">VG_DETERMINE_INTERFACE_VERSION</code>.
-The last three are registered using the
-<code class="computeroutput">VG_(basic_tool_funcs)</code> function.</p>
-<p>In addition, if a tool wants to use some of the optional services
-provided by the core, it may have to define other functions and tell the
-core about them.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="2.2.5.Initialisation">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.init"></a>2.2.5.Initialisation</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Most of the initialisation should be done in
-<code class="function">pre_clo_init</code>.  Only use
-<code class="function">post_clo_init</code> if a tool provides command line
-options and must do some initialisation after option processing takes
-place (<code class="computeroutput">"clo"</code> stands for "command line
-options").</p>
-<p>First of all, various "details" need to be set for a tool, using
-the functions <code class="function">VG_(details_*)</code>.  Some are all
-compulsory, some aren't.  Some are used when constructing the startup
-message, <code class="computeroutput">detail_bug_reports_to</code> is used
-if <code class="computeroutput">VG_(tool_panic)</code> is ever called, or
-a tool assertion fails.  Others have other uses.</p>
-<p>Second, various "needs" can be set for a tool, using the functions
-<code class="function">VG_(needs_*)</code>.  They are mostly booleans, and can
-be left untouched (they default to <code class="varname">False</code>).  They
-determine whether a tool can do various things such as: record, report
-and suppress errors; process command line options; wrap system calls;
-record extra information about heap blocks; etc.</p>
-<p>For example, if a tool wants the core's help in recording and
-reporting errors, it must call
-<code class="function">VG_(needs_tool_errors)</code> and provide definitions of
-eight functions for comparing errors, printing out errors, reading
-suppressions from a suppressions file, etc.  While writing these
-functions requires some work, it's much less than doing error handling
-from scratch because the core is doing most of the work.
-</p>
-<p>Third, the tool can indicate which events in core it wants to be
-notified about, using the functions <code class="function">VG_(track_*)</code>.
-These include things such as heap blocks being allocated, the stack
-pointer changing, a mutex being locked, etc.  If a tool wants to know
-about this, it should provide a pointer to a function, which will be
-called when that event happens.</p>
-<p>For example, if the tool want to be notified when a new heap block
-is allocated, it should call
-<code class="function">VG_(track_new_mem_heap)</code> with an appropriate
-function pointer, and the assigned function will be called each time
-this happens.</p>
-<p>More information about "details", "needs" and "trackable events"
-can be found in
-<code class="filename">include/pub_tool_tooliface.h</code>.</p>

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.instr"></a>2.2.6.Instrumentation</h3></div></div></div>
-<p><code class="function">instrument</code> is the interesting one.  It
-allows you to instrument <span class="emphasis"><em>VEX IR</em></span>, which is
-Valgrind's RISC-like intermediate language.  VEX IR is described
-in the comments of the header file
-<code class="filename">VEX/pub/libvex_ir.h</code>.</p>
-<p>The easiest way to instrument VEX IR is to insert calls to C
-functions when interesting things happen.  See the tool "Lackey"
-(<code class="filename">lackey/lk_main.c</code>) for a simple example of this, or
-Cachegrind (<code class="filename">cachegrind/cg_main.c</code>) for a more
-complex example.</p>

-<p>This is where you can present the final results, such as a summary

-<div class="sect2" title="2.2.8.Other Important Information">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.otherinfo"></a>2.2.8.Other Important Information</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Please note that the core/tool split infrastructure is quite
-complex and not brilliantly documented.  Here are some important points,
-but there are undoubtedly many others that I should note but haven't
-thought of.</p>
-<p>The files <code class="filename">include/pub_tool_*.h</code> contain all the
-types, macros, functions, etc. that a tool should (hopefully) need, and are
-the only <code class="filename">.h</code> files a tool should need to
-<code class="computeroutput">#include</code>.  They have a reasonable amount of
-documentation in it that should hopefully be enough to get you going.</p>
-<p>Note that you can't use anything from the C library (there
-are deep reasons for this, trust us).  Valgrind provides an
-implementation of a reasonable subset of the C library, details of which
-are in <code class="filename">pub_tool_libc*.h</code>.</p>
-<p>When writing a tool, in theory you shouldn't need to look at any of
-the code in Valgrind's core, but in practice it might be useful sometimes to
-help understand something.</p>
-<p>The <code class="filename">include/pub_tool_basics.h</code> and
-<code class="filename">VEX/pub/libvex_basictypes.h</code> files have some basic
-types that are widely used.</p>
-<p>Ultimately, the tools distributed (Memcheck, Cachegrind, Lackey, etc.)
-are probably the best documentation of all, for the moment.</p>
-<p>The <code class="computeroutput">VG_</code> macro is used
-heavily.  This just prepends a longer string in front of names to avoid
-potential namespace clashes.  It is defined in
-<code class="filename">include/pub_tool_basics.h</code>.</p>
-<p>There are some assorted notes about various aspects of the
-implementation in <code class="filename">docs/internals/</code>.  Much of it
-isn't that relevant to tool-writers, however.</p>

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.advtopics"></a>2.3.Advanced Topics</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Once a tool becomes more complicated, there are some extra
-things you may want/need to do.</p>
-<div class="sect2" title="2.3.1.Debugging Tips">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.advice"></a>2.3.1.Debugging Tips</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Writing and debugging tools is not trivial.  Here are some
-suggestions for solving common problems.</p>
-<p>If you are getting segmentation faults in C functions used by your
-tool, the usual GDB command:</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-  gdb &lt;prog&gt; core</pre>
-<p>usually gives the location of the segmentation fault.</p>
-<p>If you want to debug C functions used by your tool, there are
-instructions on how to do so in the file
-<code class="filename">README_DEVELOPERS</code>.</p>
-<p>If you are having problems with your VEX IR instrumentation, it's
-likely that GDB won't be able to help at all.  In this case, Valgrind's
-<code class="option">--trace-flags</code> option is invaluable for observing the
-results of instrumentation.</p>
-<p>If you just want to know whether a program point has been reached,
-using the <code class="computeroutput">OINK</code> macro (in
-<code class="filename">include/pub_tool_libcprint.h</code>) can be easier than
-using GDB.</p>
-<p>The other debugging command line options can be useful too (run
-<code class="computeroutput">valgrind --help-debug</code> for the
-list).</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="2.3.2.Suppressions">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.suppressions"></a>2.3.2.Suppressions</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>If your tool reports errors and you want to suppress some common
-ones, you can add suppressions to the suppression files.  The relevant
-files are <code class="filename">*.supp</code>; the final suppression
-file is aggregated from these files by combining the relevant
-<code class="filename">.supp</code> files depending on the versions of linux, X
-and glibc on a system.</p>
-<p>Suppression types have the form
-<code class="computeroutput">tool_name:suppression_name</code>.  The
-<code class="computeroutput">tool_name</code> here is the name you specify
-for the tool during initialisation with
-<code class="function">VG_(details_name)</code>.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="2.3.3.Documentation">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="manual-writing-tools.docs"></a>2.3.3.Documentation</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>If you are feeling conscientious and want to write some
-documentation for your tool, please use XML as the rest of Valgrind does.
-The file <code class="filename">docs/README</code> has more details on getting
-the XML toolchain to work;  this can be difficult, unfortunately.</p>
-<p>To write the documentation, follow these steps (using
-<code class="computeroutput">foobar</code> as the example tool name
-again):</p>
-<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
-<li class="listitem"><p>The docs go in
-   <code class="computeroutput">foobar/docs/</code>, which you will
-   have created when you started writing the tool.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Copy the XML documentation file for the tool Nulgrind from
-    <code class="filename">none/docs/nl-manual.xml</code> to
-    <code class="computeroutput">foobar/docs/</code>, and rename it to
-    <code class="filename">foobar/docs/fb-manual.xml</code>.</p>
-<p><span class="command"><strong>Note</strong></span>: there is a tetex bug
-    involving underscores in filenames, so don't use '_'.</p>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Write the documentation. There are some helpful bits and
-    pieces on using XML markup in
-    <code class="filename">docs/xml/xml_help.txt</code>.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Include it in the User Manual by adding the relevant entry to
-    <code class="filename">docs/xml/manual.xml</code>.  Copy and edit an
-    existing entry.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Include it in the man page by adding the relevant entry to
-    <code class="filename">docs/xml/valgrind-manpage.xml</code>.  Copy and
-    edit an existing entry.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Validate <code class="filename">foobar/docs/fb-manual.xml</code> using
-    the following command from within <code class="filename">docs/</code>:
-  </p>
-<pre class="screen">

-<p>You may get errors that look like this:</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-./xml/index.xml:5: element chapter: validity error : No declaration for
-attribute base of element chapter
-</pre>
-<p>Ignore (only) these -- they're not important.</p>
-<p>Because the XML toolchain is fragile, it is important to ensure
-   that <code class="filename">fb-manual.xml</code> won't break the documentation
-   set build.  Note that just because an XML file happily transforms to
-   html does not necessarily mean the same holds true for pdf/ps.</p>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>You can (re-)generate the HTML docs while you are writing
-    <code class="filename">fb-manual.xml</code> to help you see how it's looking.

-    command, within <code class="filename">docs/</code>:</p>
-<pre class="screen">

-<p>Check the output <code class="filename">.pdf</code> and
-    <code class="filename">.ps</code> files in
-    <code class="computeroutput">docs/print/</code>.</p>

-    so don't feel too bad if you can't get it working.</p>

-    description files, <code class="computeroutput">.stdout.exp</code> and

-    (Note that Valgrind's output goes to stderr.)  Some details on

-<p>Lots of profiling tools have trouble running Valgrind.  For example,

-<p>Probably the best way to profile a tool is with OProfile on Linux.</p>
-<p>You can also use Cachegrind on it.  Read

-<p>If you add any directories under

-an appropriate <code class="filename">Makefile.am</code> to it, and add a
-corresponding entry to the <code class="computeroutput">AC_OUTPUT</code>
-list in <code class="filename">configure.in</code>.</p>
-<p>If you add any scripts to your tool (see Cachegrind for an
-example) you need to add them to the

-<p>The core/tool interface evolves over time, but it's pretty stable.
-We deliberately do not provide backward compatibility with old interfaces,
-because it is too difficult and too restrictive.  We view this as a good
-thing -- if we had to be backward compatible with earlier versions, many
-improvements now in the system could not have been added.</p>
-<p>Because tools are statically linked with the core, if a tool compiles
-successfully then it should be compatible with the core.  We would not
-deliberately violate this property by, for example, changing the behaviour
-of a core function without changing its prototype.</p>

-<div class="sect1" title="4.2.Explanation of error messages from Memcheck">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="mc-manual.errormsgs"></a>4.2.Explanation of error messages from Memcheck</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Memcheck issues a range of error messages.  This section presents a
-quick summary of what error messages mean.  The precise behaviour of the
-error-checking machinery is described in <a class="xref" href="mc-manual.html#mc-manual.machine" title="4.5.Details of Memcheck's checking machinery">Details of Memcheck's checking machinery</a>.</p>
-<div class="sect2" title="4.2.1.Illegal read / Illegal write errors">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.badrw"></a>4.2.1.Illegal read / Illegal write errors</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>For example:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-Invalid read of size 4
-   at 0x40F6BBCC: (within /usr/lib/libpng.so.2.1.0.9)
-   by 0x40F6B804: (within /usr/lib/libpng.so.2.1.0.9)
-   by 0x40B07FF4: read_png_image(QImageIO *) (kernel/qpngio.cpp:326)
-   by 0x40AC751B: QImageIO::read() (kernel/qimage.cpp:3621)
- Address 0xBFFFF0E0 is not stack'd, malloc'd or free'd
-</pre>
-<p>This happens when your program reads or writes memory at a place
-which Memcheck reckons it shouldn't.  In this example, the program did a
-4-byte read at address 0xBFFFF0E0, somewhere within the system-supplied
-library libpng.so.2.1.0.9, which was called from somewhere else in the
-same library, called from line 326 of <code class="filename">qpngio.cpp</code>,
-and so on.</p>
-<p>Memcheck tries to establish what the illegal address might relate
-to, since that's often useful.  So, if it points into a block of memory
-which has already been freed, you'll be informed of this, and also where
-the block was freed.  Likewise, if it should turn out to be just off
-the end of a heap block, a common result of off-by-one-errors in
-array subscripting, you'll be informed of this fact, and also where the
-block was allocated.  If you use the <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="manual-core.html#opt.read-var-info">--read-var-info</a></code> option Memcheck will run more slowly
-but may give a more detailed description of any illegal address.</p>
-<p>In this example, Memcheck can't identify the address.  Actually
-the address is on the stack, but, for some reason, this is not a valid
-stack address -- it is below the stack pointer and that isn't allowed.
-In this particular case it's probably caused by GCC generating invalid
-code, a known bug in some ancient versions of GCC.</p>
-<p>Note that Memcheck only tells you that your program is about to
-access memory at an illegal address.  It can't stop the access from
-happening.  So, if your program makes an access which normally would
-result in a segmentation fault, you program will still suffer the same
-fate -- but you will get a message from Memcheck immediately prior to
-this.  In this particular example, reading junk on the stack is
-non-fatal, and the program stays alive.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="4.2.2.Use of uninitialised values">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.uninitvals"></a>4.2.2.Use of uninitialised values</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>For example:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
-   at 0x402DFA94: _IO_vfprintf (_itoa.h:49)
-   by 0x402E8476: _IO_printf (printf.c:36)
-   by 0x8048472: main (tests/manuel1.c:8)
-</pre>
-<p>An uninitialised-value use error is reported when your program
-uses a value which hasn't been initialised -- in other words, is
-undefined.  Here, the undefined value is used somewhere inside the
-<code class="function">printf</code> machinery of the C library.  This error was
-reported when running the following small program:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-int main()
-{
-  int x;
-  printf ("x = %d\n", x);
-}</pre>
-<p>It is important to understand that your program can copy around
-junk (uninitialised) data as much as it likes.  Memcheck observes this
-and keeps track of the data, but does not complain.  A complaint is
-issued only when your program attempts to make use of uninitialised
-data in a way that might affect your program's externally-visible behaviour.
-In this example, <code class="varname">x</code> is uninitialised.  Memcheck observes
-the value being passed to <code class="function">_IO_printf</code> and thence to
-<code class="function">_IO_vfprintf</code>, but makes no comment.  However,
-<code class="function">_IO_vfprintf</code> has to examine the value of
-<code class="varname">x</code> so it can turn it into the corresponding ASCII string,
-and it is at this point that Memcheck complains.</p>
-<p>Sources of uninitialised data tend to be:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>Local variables in procedures which have not been initialised,
-    as in the example above.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>The contents of heap blocks (allocated with
-    <code class="function">malloc</code>, <code class="function">new</code>, or a similar
-    function) before you (or a constructor) write something there.
-    </p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>To see information on the sources of uninitialised data in your
-program, use the <code class="option">--track-origins=yes</code> option.  This
-makes Memcheck run more slowly, but can make it much easier to track down
-the root causes of uninitialised value errors.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="4.2.3.Use of uninitialised or unaddressable values in system calls">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.bad-syscall-args"></a>4.2.3.Use of uninitialised or unaddressable values in system
-       calls</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Memcheck checks all parameters to system calls:
-</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>It checks all the direct parameters themselves, whether they are
-    initialised.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Also, if a system call needs to read from a buffer provided by
-    your program, Memcheck checks that the entire buffer is addressable
-    and its contents are initialised.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Also, if the system call needs to write to a user-supplied
-    buffer, Memcheck checks that the buffer is addressable.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>
-</p>
-<p>After the system call, Memcheck updates its tracked information to
-precisely reflect any changes in memory state caused by the system
-call.</p>
-<p>Here's an example of two system calls with invalid parameters:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
-  #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
-  int main( void )
-  {
-    char* arr  = malloc(10);
-    int*  arr2 = malloc(sizeof(int));
-    write( 1 /* stdout */, arr, 10 );
-    exit(arr2[0]);
-  }
-</pre>
-<p>You get these complaints ...</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">

-legitimate or not.  Here, this test program has freed the same block
-twice.  As with the illegal read/write errors, Memcheck attempts to

-<p>In <code class="literal">C++</code> it's important to deallocate memory in a
-way compatible with how it was allocated.  The deal is:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>If allocated with
-    <code class="function">malloc</code>,
-    <code class="function">calloc</code>,
-    <code class="function">realloc</code>,
-    <code class="function">valloc</code> or
-    <code class="function">memalign</code>, you must
-    deallocate with <code class="function">free</code>.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>If allocated with <code class="function">new</code>, you must deallocate
-   with <code class="function">delete</code>.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>If allocated with <code class="function">new[]</code>, you must
-    deallocate with <code class="function">delete[]</code>.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>The worst thing is that on Linux apparently it doesn't matter if
-you do mix these up, but the same program may then crash on a
-different platform, Solaris for example.  So it's best to fix it
-properly.  According to the KDE folks "it's amazing how many C++
-programmers don't know this".</p>
-<p>The reason behind the requirement is as follows.  In some C++
-implementations, <code class="function">delete[]</code> must be used for
-objects allocated by <code class="function">new[]</code> because the compiler
-stores the size of the array and the pointer-to-member to the
-destructor of the array's content just before the pointer actually
-returned.  <code class="function">delete</code> doesn't account for this and will get
-confused, possibly corrupting the heap.</p>

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.overlap"></a>4.2.6.Overlapping source and destination blocks</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>The following C library functions copy some data from one
-memory block to another (or something similar):
-<code class="function">memcpy</code>,
-<code class="function">strcpy</code>,
-<code class="function">strncpy</code>,
-<code class="function">strcat</code>,
-<code class="function">strncat</code>. 
-The blocks pointed to by their <code class="computeroutput">src</code> and
-<code class="computeroutput">dst</code> pointers aren't allowed to overlap.
-The POSIX standards have wording along the lines "If copying takes place
-between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined." Therefore,
-Memcheck checks for this.
-</p>
-<p>For example:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-==27492== Source and destination overlap in memcpy(0xbffff294, 0xbffff280, 21)
-==27492==    at 0x40026CDC: memcpy (mc_replace_strmem.c:71)
-==27492==    by 0x804865A: main (overlap.c:40)
-</pre>
-<p>You don't want the two blocks to overlap because one of them could
-get partially overwritten by the copying.</p>
-<p>You might think that Memcheck is being overly pedantic reporting
-this in the case where <code class="computeroutput">dst</code> is less than
-<code class="computeroutput">src</code>.  For example, the obvious way to
-implement <code class="function">memcpy</code> is by copying from the first
-byte to the last.  However, the optimisation guides of some
-architectures recommend copying from the last byte down to the first.
-Also, some implementations of <code class="function">memcpy</code> zero
-<code class="computeroutput">dst</code> before copying, because zeroing the
-destination's cache line(s) can improve performance.</p>
-<p>The moral of the story is: if you want to write truly portable
-code, don't make any assumptions about the language
-implementation.</p>

-<p>Memcheck keeps track of all heap blocks issued in response to
-calls to
-<code class="function">malloc</code>/<code class="function">new</code> et al.
-So when the program exits, it knows which blocks have not been freed.
-</p>
-<p>If <code class="option">--leak-check</code> is set appropriately, for each
-remaining block, Memcheck determines if the block is reachable from pointers
-within the root-set.  The root-set consists of (a) general purpose registers
-of all threads, and (b) initialised, aligned, pointer-sized data words in
-accessible client memory, including stacks.</p>
-<p>There are two ways a block can be reached.  The first is with a
-"start-pointer", i.e. a pointer to the start of the block.  The second is with
-an "interior-pointer", i.e. a pointer to the middle of the block.  There are
-three ways we know of that an interior-pointer can occur:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>The pointer might have originally been a start-pointer and have been
-    moved along deliberately (or not deliberately) by the program.  In
-    particular, this can happen if your program uses tagged pointers, i.e.
-    if it uses the bottom one, two or three bits of a pointer, which are
-    normally always zero due to alignment, in order to store extra
-    information.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>It might be a random junk value in memory, entirely unrelated, just
-    a coincidence.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>It might be a pointer to an array of C++ objects (which possess
-    destructors) allocated with <code class="computeroutput">new[]</code>.  In
-    this case, some compilers store a "magic cookie" containing the array
-    length at the start of the allocated block, and return a pointer to just
-    past that magic cookie, i.e. an interior-pointer.
-    See <a class="ulink" href="http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/gnu/gcc/gxxint_14.html" target="_top">this

-</ul></div>
-<p>With that in mind, consider the nine possible cases described by the

-</pre>
-<p>Every possible case can be reduced to one of the above nine.  Memcheck
-merges some of these cases in its output, resulting in the following four
-categories.</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>"Still reachable". This covers cases 1 and 2 (for the BBB blocks)
-    above.  A start-pointer or chain of start-pointers to the block is
-    found.  Since the block is still pointed at, the programmer could, at
-    least in principle, have freed it before program exit.  Because these
-    are very common and arguably not a problem, Memcheck won't report such
-    blocks individually unless <code class="option">--show-reachable=yes</code> is
-    specified.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>"Definitely lost".  This covers case 3 (for the BBB blocks) above.
-    This means that no pointer to the block can be found.  The block is
-    classified as "lost", because the programmer could not possibly have
-    freed it at program exit, since no pointer to it exists.  This is likely
-    a symptom of having lost the pointer at some earlier point in the
-    program.  Such cases should be fixed by the programmer.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>"Indirectly lost".  This covers cases 4 and 9 (for the BBB blocks)
-    above.  This means that the block is lost, not because there are no
-    pointers to it, but rather because all the blocks that point to it are
-    themselves lost.  For example, if you have a binary tree and the root
-    node is lost, all its children nodes will be indirectly lost.  Because
-    the problem will disappear if the definitely lost block that caused the
-    indirect leak is fixed, Memcheck won't report such blocks individually
-    unless <code class="option">--show-reachable=yes</code> is specified.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>"Possibly lost".  This covers cases 5--8 (for the BBB blocks)
-    above.  This means that a chain of one or more pointers to the block has
-    been found, but at least one of the pointers is an interior-pointer.
-    This could just be a random value in memory that happens to point into a
-    block, and so you shouldn't consider this ok unless you know you have
-    interior-pointers.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>(Note: This mapping of the nine possible cases onto four categories is
-not necessarily the best way that leaks could be reported;  in particular,
-interior-pointers are treated inconsistently.  It is possible the
-categorisation may be improved in the future.)</p>
-<p>Furthermore, if suppressions exists for a block, it will be reported
-as "suppressed" no matter what which of the above four categories it belongs
-to.</p>
-<p>The following is an example leak summary.</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-LEAK SUMMARY:
-   definitely lost: 48 bytes in 3 blocks.
-   indirectly lost: 32 bytes in 2 blocks.
-     possibly lost: 96 bytes in 6 blocks.
-   still reachable: 64 bytes in 4 blocks.
-        suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks.
-</pre>
-<p>If <code class="option">--leak-check=full</code> is specified,
-Memcheck will give details for each definitely lost or possibly lost block,
-including where it was allocated.  (Actually, it merges results for all
-blocks that have the same category and sufficiently similar stack traces
-into a single "loss record".  The
-<code class="option">--leak-resolution</code> lets you control the
-meaning of "sufficiently similar".)  It cannot tell you when or how or why
-the pointer to a leaked block was lost; you have to work that out for
-yourself.  In general, you should attempt to ensure your programs do not
-have any definitely lost or possibly lost blocks at exit.</p>
-<p>For example:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-8 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 14
-   at 0x........: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:...)
-   by 0x........: mk (leak-tree.c:11)
-   by 0x........: main (leak-tree.c:39)
-
-88 (8 direct, 80 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 13 of 14
-   at 0x........: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:...)
-   by 0x........: mk (leak-tree.c:11)
-   by 0x........: main (leak-tree.c:25)
-</pre>
-<p>The first message describes a simple case of a single 8 byte block
-that has been definitely lost.  The second case mentions another 8 byte
-block that has been definitely lost;  the difference is that a further 80
-bytes in other blocks are indirectly lost because of this lost block.
-The loss records are not presented in any notable order, so the loss record
-numbers aren't particularly meaningful.</p>
-<p>If you specify <code class="option">--show-reachable=yes</code>,
-reachable and indirectly lost blocks will also be shown, as the following
-two examples show.</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-64 bytes in 4 blocks are still reachable in loss record 2 of 4
-   at 0x........: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:177)
-   by 0x........: mk (leak-cases.c:52)
-   by 0x........: main (leak-cases.c:74)
-
-32 bytes in 2 blocks are indirectly lost in loss record 1 of 4
-   at 0x........: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:177)
-   by 0x........: mk (leak-cases.c:52)
-   by 0x........: main (leak-cases.c:80)
-</pre>
-<p>Because there are different kinds of leaks with different severities, an
-interesting question is this: which leaks should be counted as true "errors"
-and which should not?  The answer to this question affects the numbers printed
-in the <code class="computeroutput">ERROR SUMMARY</code> line, and also the effect
-of the <code class="option">--error-exitcode</code> option.  Memcheck uses the following
-criteria:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>First, a leak is only counted as a true "error" if
-    <code class="option">--leak-check=full</code> is specified.  In other words, an
-    unprinted leak is not considered a true "error".  If this were not the
-    case, it would be possible to get a high error count but not have any
-    errors printed, which would be confusing.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>After that, definitely lost and possibly lost blocks are counted as
-    true "errors".  Indirectly lost and still reachable blocks are not counted
-    as true "errors", even if <code class="option">--show-reachable=yes</code> is
-    specified and they are printed;  this is because such blocks don't need
-    direct fixing by the programmer.
-    </p></li>

-        cannot tell you where the uninitialised value came from.  This
-        often makes it difficult to track down the root problem.
-        </p>
-<p>When set
-        to <code class="varname">yes</code>, Memcheck keeps
-        track of the origins of all uninitialised values.  Then, when
-        an uninitialised value error is
-        reported, Memcheck will try to show the
-        origin of the value.  An origin can be one of the following
-        four places: a heap block, a stack allocation, a client
-        request, or miscellaneous other sources (eg, a call
-        to <code class="varname">brk</code>).
-        </p>
-<p>For uninitialised values originating from a heap
-        block, Memcheck shows where the block was
-        allocated.  For uninitialised values originating from a stack
-        allocation, Memcheck can tell you which
-        function allocated the value, but no more than that -- typically
-        it shows you the source location of the opening brace of the
-        function.  So you should carefully check that all of the
-        function's local variables are initialised properly.
-        </p>
-<p>Performance overhead: origin tracking is expensive.  It
-        halves Memcheck's speed and increases
-        memory use by a minimum of 100MB, and possibly more.
-        Nevertheless it can drastically reduce the effort required to
-        identify the root cause of uninitialised value errors, and so
-        is often a programmer productivity win, despite running
-        more slowly.
-        </p>
-<p>Accuracy: Memcheck tracks origins
-        quite accurately.  To avoid very large space and time
-        overheads, some approximations are made.  It is possible,
-        although unlikely, that Memcheck will report an incorrect origin, or
-        not be able to identify any origin.

-<p>Note that the combination
-        <code class="option">--track-origins=yes</code>

-<a name="mc-manual.machine"></a>4.5.Details of Memcheck's checking machinery</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Read this section if you want to know, in detail, exactly
-what and how Memcheck is checking.</p>
-<div class="sect2" title="4.5.1.Valid-value (V) bits">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.value"></a>4.5.1.Valid-value (V) bits</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>It is simplest to think of Memcheck implementing a synthetic CPU
-which is identical to a real CPU, except for one crucial detail.  Every
-bit (literally) of data processed, stored and handled by the real CPU
-has, in the synthetic CPU, an associated "valid-value" bit, which says
-whether or not the accompanying bit has a legitimate value.  In the
-discussions which follow, this bit is referred to as the V (valid-value)
-bit.</p>
-<p>Each byte in the system therefore has a 8 V bits which follow it
-wherever it goes.  For example, when the CPU loads a word-size item (4
-bytes) from memory, it also loads the corresponding 32 V bits from a
-bitmap which stores the V bits for the process' entire address space.
-If the CPU should later write the whole or some part of that value to
-memory at a different address, the relevant V bits will be stored back
-in the V-bit bitmap.</p>
-<p>In short, each bit in the system has (conceptually) an associated V
-bit, which follows it around everywhere, even inside the CPU.  Yes, all the
-CPU's registers (integer, floating point, vector and condition registers)
-have their own V bit vectors.  For this to work, Memcheck uses a great deal
-of compression to represent the V bits compactly.</p>
-<p>Copying values around does not cause Memcheck to check for, or
-report on, errors.  However, when a value is used in a way which might
-conceivably affect your program's externally-visible behaviour,
-the associated V bits are immediately checked.  If any of these indicate
-that the value is undefined (even partially), an error is reported.</p>
-<p>Here's an (admittedly nonsensical) example:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-int i, j;
-int a[10], b[10];
-for ( i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ ) {
-  j = a[i];
-  b[i] = j;
-}</pre>
-<p>Memcheck emits no complaints about this, since it merely copies
-uninitialised values from <code class="varname">a[]</code> into
-<code class="varname">b[]</code>, and doesn't use them in a way which could
-affect the behaviour of the program.  However, if
-the loop is changed to:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-for ( i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ ) {
-  j += a[i];
-}
-if ( j == 77 ) 
-  printf("hello there\n");
-</pre>
-<p>then Memcheck will complain, at the
-<code class="computeroutput">if</code>, that the condition depends on
-uninitialised values.  Note that it <span class="command"><strong>doesn't</strong></span> complain
-at the <code class="varname">j += a[i];</code>, since at that point the
-undefinedness is not "observable".  It's only when a decision has to be
-made as to whether or not to do the <code class="function">printf</code> -- an
-observable action of your program -- that Memcheck complains.</p>
-<p>Most low level operations, such as adds, cause Memcheck to use the
-V bits for the operands to calculate the V bits for the result.  Even if
-the result is partially or wholly undefined, it does not
-complain.</p>
-<p>Checks on definedness only occur in three places: when a value is
-used to generate a memory address, when control flow decision needs to
-be made, and when a system call is detected, Memcheck checks definedness
-of parameters as required.</p>
-<p>If a check should detect undefinedness, an error message is
-issued.  The resulting value is subsequently regarded as well-defined.
-To do otherwise would give long chains of error messages.  In other
-words, once Memcheck reports an undefined value error, it tries to
-avoid reporting further errors derived from that same undefined
-value.</p>
-<p>This sounds overcomplicated.  Why not just check all reads from
-memory, and complain if an undefined value is loaded into a CPU
-register?  Well, that doesn't work well, because perfectly legitimate C
-programs routinely copy uninitialised values around in memory, and we
-don't want endless complaints about that.  Here's the canonical example.
-Consider a struct like this:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-struct S { int x; char c; };
-struct S s1, s2;
-s1.x = 42;
-s1.c = 'z';
-s2 = s1;
-</pre>
-<p>The question to ask is: how large is <code class="varname">struct S</code>,
-in bytes?  An <code class="varname">int</code> is 4 bytes and a
-<code class="varname">char</code> one byte, so perhaps a <code class="varname">struct
-S</code> occupies 5 bytes?  Wrong.  All non-toy compilers we know
-of will round the size of <code class="varname">struct S</code> up to a whole
-number of words, in this case 8 bytes.  Not doing this forces compilers
-to generate truly appalling code for accessing arrays of
-<code class="varname">struct S</code>'s on some architectures.</p>
-<p>So <code class="varname">s1</code> occupies 8 bytes, yet only 5 of them will
-be initialised.  For the assignment <code class="varname">s2 = s1</code>, GCC
-generates code to copy all 8 bytes wholesale into <code class="varname">s2</code>
-without regard for their meaning.  If Memcheck simply checked values as
-they came out of memory, it would yelp every time a structure assignment
-like this happened.  So the more complicated behaviour described above
-is necessary.  This allows GCC to copy
-<code class="varname">s1</code> into <code class="varname">s2</code> any way it likes, and a
-warning will only be emitted if the uninitialised values are later
-used.</p>

-<div class="sect2" title="4.5.2.Valid-address (A) bits">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.vaddress"></a>4.5.2.Valid-address (A) bits</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Notice that the previous subsection describes how the validity of
-values is established and maintained without having to say whether the
-program does or does not have the right to access any particular memory
-location.  We now consider the latter question.</p>
-<p>As described above, every bit in memory or in the CPU has an
-associated valid-value (V) bit.  In addition, all bytes in memory, but
-not in the CPU, have an associated valid-address (A) bit.  This
-indicates whether or not the program can legitimately read or write that
-location.  It does not give any indication of the validity of the data
-at that location -- that's the job of the V bits -- only whether or not
-the location may be accessed.</p>
-<p>Every time your program reads or writes memory, Memcheck checks
-the A bits associated with the address.  If any of them indicate an
-invalid address, an error is emitted.  Note that the reads and writes
-themselves do not change the A bits, only consult them.</p>
-<p>So how do the A bits get set/cleared?  Like this:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>When the program starts, all the global data areas are
-    marked as accessible.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>When the program does
-    <code class="function">malloc</code>/<code class="computeroutput">new</code>,
-    the A bits for exactly the area allocated, and not a byte more,
-    are marked as accessible.  Upon freeing the area the A bits are
-    changed to indicate inaccessibility.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>When the stack pointer register (<code class="literal">SP</code>) moves
-    up or down, A bits are set.  The rule is that the area from
-    <code class="literal">SP</code> up to the base of the stack is marked as
-    accessible, and below <code class="literal">SP</code> is inaccessible.  (If
-    that sounds illogical, bear in mind that the stack grows down, not
-    up, on almost all Unix systems, including GNU/Linux.)  Tracking
-    <code class="literal">SP</code> like this has the useful side-effect that the
-    section of stack used by a function for local variables etc is
-    automatically marked accessible on function entry and inaccessible
-    on exit.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>When doing system calls, A bits are changed appropriately.
-    For example, <code class="literal">mmap</code>
-    magically makes files appear in the process'
-    address space, so the A bits must be updated if <code class="literal">mmap</code>
-    succeeds.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Optionally, your program can tell Memcheck about such changes
-    explicitly, using the client request mechanism described
-    above.</p></li>

-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.together"></a>4.5.3.Putting it all together</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Memcheck's checking machinery can be summarised as
-follows:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>Each byte in memory has 8 associated V (valid-value) bits,
-    saying whether or not the byte has a defined value, and a single A
-    (valid-address) bit, saying whether or not the program currently has
-    the right to read/write that address.  As mentioned above, heavy
-    use of compression means the overhead is typically around 25%.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>When memory is read or written, the relevant A bits are
-    consulted.  If they indicate an invalid address, Memcheck emits an
-    Invalid read or Invalid write error.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>When memory is read into the CPU's registers, the relevant V
-    bits are fetched from memory and stored in the simulated CPU.  They
-    are not consulted.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>When a register is written out to memory, the V bits for that
-    register are written back to memory too.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>When values in CPU registers are used to generate a memory
-    address, or to determine the outcome of a conditional branch, the V
-    bits for those values are checked, and an error emitted if any of
-    them are undefined.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>When values in CPU registers are used for any other purpose,
-    Memcheck computes the V bits for the result, but does not check
-    them.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Once the V bits for a value in the CPU have been checked, they
-    are then set to indicate validity.  This avoids long chains of
-    errors.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>When values are loaded from memory, Memcheck checks the A bits
-    for that location and issues an illegal-address warning if needed.
-    In that case, the V bits loaded are forced to indicate Valid,
-    despite the location being invalid.</p>
-<p>This apparently strange choice reduces the amount of confusing
-    information presented to the user.  It avoids the unpleasant
-    phenomenon in which memory is read from a place which is both
-    unaddressable and contains invalid values, and, as a result, you get
-    not only an invalid-address (read/write) error, but also a
-    potentially large set of uninitialised-value errors, one for every
-    time the value is used.</p>
-<p>There is a hazy boundary case to do with multi-byte loads from
-    addresses which are partially valid and partially invalid.  See
-    details of the option <code class="option">--partial-loads-ok</code> for details.

-    marks the entire area it points at as unaddressable, and places
-    the block in the freed-blocks-queue.  The aim is to defer as long

-    report is requested, the next two arguments further specify what
-    kind of leaks to report.  A leak's details are shown if they match
-    both the second and third argument. A full leak report might
-    output detailed information for many leaks. The nr of leaks for
-    which information is output can be controlled using
-    the <code class="varname">limited</code> argument followed by the maximum nr
-    of leak records to output. If this maximum is reached, the leak
-    search  outputs the records with the biggest number of bytes.
-    </p>
-<p>The second argument controls what kind of blocks are shown for
-    a <code class="varname">full</code> leak search.  The
-    value <code class="varname">definiteleak</code> specifies that only
-    definitely leaked blocks should be shown.  The
-    value <code class="varname">possibleleak</code> will also show possibly
-    leaked blocks (those for which only an interior pointer was
-    found).  The value
-    <code class="varname">reachable</code> will show all block categories
-    (reachable, possibly leaked, definitely leaked).
-    </p>
-<p>The third argument controls what kinds of changes are shown
-    for a <code class="varname">full</code> leak search. The
-    value <code class="varname">increased</code> specifies that only block
-    allocation stacks with an increased number of leaked bytes or
-    blocks since the previous leak check should be shown.  The
-    value <code class="varname">changed</code> specifies that allocation stacks
-    with any change since the previous leak check should be shown.
-    The value <code class="varname">any</code> specifies that all leak entries
-    should be shown, regardless of any increase or decrease.  When
-    If <code class="varname">increased</code> or <code class="varname">changed</code> are
-    specified, the leak report entries will show the delta relative to
-    the previous leak report.
-    </p>
-<p>The following example shows usage of the 
-    <code class="varname">leak_check</code> monitor command on
-    the <code class="varname">memcheck/tests/leak-cases.c</code> regression
-    test. The first command outputs one entry having an increase in
-    the leaked bytes.  The second command is the same as the first
-    command, but uses the abbreviated forms accepted by GDB and the
-    Valgrind gdbserver. It only outputs the summary information, as
-    there was no increase since the previous leak search.</p>

-<a name="mc-manual.mempools"></a>4.8.Memory Pools: describing and working with custom allocators</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Some programs use custom memory allocators, often for performance
-reasons.  Left to itself, Memcheck is unable to understand the
-behaviour of custom allocation schemes as well as it understands the
-standard allocators, and so may miss errors and leaks in your program.  What
-this section describes is a way to give Memcheck enough of a description of
-your custom allocator that it can make at least some sense of what is
-happening.</p>
-<p>There are many different sorts of custom allocator, so Memcheck
-attempts to reason about them using a loose, abstract model.  We
-use the following terminology when describing custom allocation
-systems:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>Custom allocation involves a set of independent "memory pools".
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Memcheck's notion of a a memory pool consists of a single "anchor
-    address" and a set of non-overlapping "chunks" associated with the
-    anchor address.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Typically a pool's anchor address is the address of a 
-    book-keeping "header" structure.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Typically the pool's chunks are drawn from a contiguous
-    "superblock" acquired through the system
-    <code class="function">malloc</code> or
-    <code class="function">mmap</code>.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>Keep in mind that the last two points above say "typically": the
-Valgrind mempool client request API is intentionally vague about the
-exact structure of a mempool. There is no specific mention made of
-headers or superblocks. Nevertheless, the following picture may help
-elucidate the intention of the terms in the API:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-   "pool"
-   (anchor address)
-   |
-   v
-   +--------+---+
-   | header | o |
-   +--------+-|-+
-              |
-              v                  superblock
-              +------+---+--------------+---+------------------+
-              |      |rzB|  allocation  |rzB|                  |
-              +------+---+--------------+---+------------------+
-                         ^              ^
-                         |              |
-                       "addr"     "addr"+"size"
-</pre>
-<p>
-Note that the header and the superblock may be contiguous or
-discontiguous, and there may be multiple superblocks associated with a
-single header; such variations are opaque to Memcheck. The API
-only requires that your allocation scheme can present sensible values
-of "pool", "addr" and "size".</p>
-<p>
-Typically, before making client requests related to mempools, a client
-program will have allocated such a header and superblock for their
-mempool, and marked the superblock NOACCESS using the
-<code class="varname">VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_NOACCESS</code> client request.</p>
-<p>
-When dealing with mempools, the goal is to maintain a particular
-invariant condition: that Memcheck believes the unallocated portions
-of the pool's superblock (including redzones) are NOACCESS. To
-maintain this invariant, the client program must ensure that the
-superblock starts out in that state; Memcheck cannot make it so, since
-Memcheck never explicitly learns about the superblock of a pool, only
-the allocated chunks within the pool.</p>
-<p>
-Once the header and superblock for a pool are established and properly
-marked, there are a number of client requests programs can use to
-inform Memcheck about changes to the state of a mempool:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>
-    <code class="varname">VALGRIND_CREATE_MEMPOOL(pool, rzB, is_zeroed)</code>:
-    This request registers the address <code class="varname">pool</code> as the anchor
-    address for a memory pool. It also provides a size
-    <code class="varname">rzB</code>, specifying how large the redzones placed around
-    chunks allocated from the pool should be. Finally, it provides an
-    <code class="varname">is_zeroed</code> argument that specifies whether the pool's
-    chunks are zeroed (more precisely: defined) when allocated.
-    </p>
-<p>
-    Upon completion of this request, no chunks are associated with the
-    pool.  The request simply tells Memcheck that the pool exists, so that
-    subsequent calls can refer to it as a pool.
-    </p>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="varname">VALGRIND_DESTROY_MEMPOOL(pool)</code>:
-    This request tells Memcheck that a pool is being torn down. Memcheck
-    then removes all records of chunks associated with the pool, as well
-    as its record of the pool's existence. While destroying its records of
-    a mempool, Memcheck resets the redzones of any live chunks in the pool
-    to NOACCESS.
-    </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="varname">VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_ALLOC(pool, addr, size)</code>:
-    This request informs Memcheck that a <code class="varname">size</code>-byte chunk
-    has been allocated at <code class="varname">addr</code>, and associates the chunk with the
-    specified
-    <code class="varname">pool</code>. If the pool was created with nonzero
-    <code class="varname">rzB</code> redzones, Memcheck will mark the
-    <code class="varname">rzB</code> bytes before and after the chunk as NOACCESS. If
-    the pool was created with the <code class="varname">is_zeroed</code> argument set,
-    Memcheck will mark the chunk as DEFINED, otherwise Memcheck will mark

-<p>Memcheck supports debugging of distributed-memory applications
-which use the MPI message passing standard.  This support consists of a
-library of wrapper functions for the
-<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_*</code> interface.  When incorporated
-into the application's address space, either by direct linking or by
-<code class="computeroutput">LD_PRELOAD</code>, the wrappers intercept
-calls to <code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Send</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Recv</code>, etc.  They then
-use client requests to inform Memcheck of memory state changes caused
-by the function being wrapped.  This reduces the number of false
-positives that Memcheck otherwise typically reports for MPI
-applications.</p>
-<p>The wrappers also take the opportunity to carefully check
-size and definedness of buffers passed as arguments to MPI functions, hence
-detecting errors such as passing undefined data to
-<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Send</code>, or receiving data into a
-buffer which is too small.</p>
-<p>Unlike most of the rest of Valgrind, the wrapper library is subject to a
-BSD-style license, so you can link it into any code base you like.
-See the top of <code class="computeroutput">mpi/libmpiwrap.c</code>
-for license details.</p>
-<div class="sect2" title="4.9.1.Building and installing the wrappers">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.mpiwrap.build"></a>4.9.1.Building and installing the wrappers</h3></div></div></div>
-<p> The wrapper library will be built automatically if possible.
-Valgrind's configure script will look for a suitable
-<code class="computeroutput">mpicc</code> to build it with.  This must be
-the same <code class="computeroutput">mpicc</code> you use to build the
-MPI application you want to debug.  By default, Valgrind tries
-<code class="computeroutput">mpicc</code>, but you can specify a
-different one by using the configure-time option
-<code class="option">--with-mpicc</code>.  Currently the
-wrappers are only buildable with
-<code class="computeroutput">mpicc</code>s which are based on GNU
-GCC or Intel's C++ Compiler.</p>
-<p>Check that the configure script prints a line like this:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-checking for usable MPI2-compliant mpicc and mpi.h... yes, mpicc
-</pre>
-<p>If it says <code class="computeroutput">... no</code>, your
-<code class="computeroutput">mpicc</code> has failed to compile and link
-a test MPI2 program.</p>
-<p>If the configure test succeeds, continue in the usual way with
-<code class="computeroutput">make</code> and <code class="computeroutput">make
-install</code>.  The final install tree should then contain
-<code class="computeroutput">libmpiwrap-&lt;platform&gt;.so</code>.
-</p>
-<p>Compile up a test MPI program (eg, MPI hello-world) and try
-this:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-LD_PRELOAD=$prefix/lib/valgrind/libmpiwrap-&lt;platform&gt;.so   \
-           mpirun [args] $prefix/bin/valgrind ./hello
-</pre>
-<p>You should see something similar to the following</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-valgrind MPI wrappers 31901: Active for pid 31901
-valgrind MPI wrappers 31901: Try MPIWRAP_DEBUG=help for possible options
-</pre>
-<p>repeated for every process in the group.  If you do not see
-these, there is an build/installation problem of some kind.</p>
-<p> The MPI functions to be wrapped are assumed to be in an ELF
-shared object with soname matching
-<code class="computeroutput">libmpi.so*</code>.  This is known to be
-correct at least for Open MPI and Quadrics MPI, and can easily be
-changed if required.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="4.9.2.Getting started">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.mpiwrap.gettingstarted"></a>4.9.2.Getting started</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Compile your MPI application as usual, taking care to link it
-using the same <code class="computeroutput">mpicc</code> that your
-Valgrind build was configured with.</p>
-<p>
-Use the following basic scheme to run your application on Valgrind with
-the wrappers engaged:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-MPIWRAP_DEBUG=[wrapper-args]                                  \
-   LD_PRELOAD=$prefix/lib/valgrind/libmpiwrap-&lt;platform&gt;.so   \
-   mpirun [mpirun-args]                                       \
-   $prefix/bin/valgrind [valgrind-args]                       \
-   [application] [app-args]
-</pre>
-<p>As an alternative to
-<code class="computeroutput">LD_PRELOAD</code>ing
-<code class="computeroutput">libmpiwrap-&lt;platform&gt;.so</code>, you can
-simply link it to your application if desired.  This should not disturb
-native behaviour of your application in any way.</p>

-<p> and then be relatively quiet.</p>
-<p>You can give a list of comma-separated options in

-<li class="listitem"><p><code class="computeroutput">strict</code>:

-<p> If you want to use Valgrind's XML output facility

-<p>All MPI2 functions except
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Wtick</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Wtime</code> and
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Pcontrol</code> have wrappers.  The
-first two are not wrapped because they return a 
-<code class="computeroutput">double</code>, which Valgrind's
-function-wrap mechanism cannot handle (but it could easily be
-extended to do so).  <code class="computeroutput">MPI_Pcontrol</code> cannot be
-wrapped as it has variable arity: 
-<code class="computeroutput">int MPI_Pcontrol(const int level, ...)</code></p>
-<p>Most functions are wrapped with a default wrapper which does
-nothing except complain or abort if it is called, depending on
-settings in <code class="computeroutput">MPIWRAP_DEBUG</code> listed
-above.  The following functions have "real", do-something-useful
-wrappers:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-PMPI_Send PMPI_Bsend PMPI_Ssend PMPI_Rsend
-
-PMPI_Recv PMPI_Get_count
-
-PMPI_Isend PMPI_Ibsend PMPI_Issend PMPI_Irsend
-
-PMPI_Irecv
-PMPI_Wait PMPI_Waitall
-PMPI_Test PMPI_Testall

-PMPI_Reduce PMPI_Allreduce PMPI_Op_create

-PMPI_Comm_create PMPI_Comm_dup PMPI_Comm_free PMPI_Comm_rank PMPI_Comm_size
-
-PMPI_Error_string
-PMPI_Init PMPI_Initialized PMPI_Finalize
-</pre>
-<p> A few functions such as
-<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Address</code> are listed as
-<code class="computeroutput">HAS_NO_WRAPPER</code>.  They have no wrapper
-at all as there is nothing worth checking, and giving a no-op wrapper
-would reduce performance for no reason.</p>
-<p> Note that the wrapper library itself can itself generate large
-numbers of calls to the MPI implementation, especially when walking
-complex types.  The most common functions called are
-<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Extent</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Type_get_envelope</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Type_get_contents</code>, and
-<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Type_free</code>.  </p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="4.9.5.Types">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.mpiwrap.limitations.types"></a>4.9.5.Types</h3></div></div></div>
-<p> MPI-1.1 structured types are supported, and walked exactly.
-The currently supported combiners are
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_NAMED</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_CONTIGUOUS</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_VECTOR</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_HVECTOR</code>
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_INDEXED</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_HINDEXED</code> and
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_STRUCT</code>.  This should
-cover all MPI-1.1 types.  The mechanism (function
-<code class="computeroutput">walk_type</code>) should extend easily to
-cover MPI2 combiners.</p>
-<p>MPI defines some named structured types
-(<code class="computeroutput">MPI_FLOAT_INT</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_DOUBLE_INT</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_LONG_INT</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_2INT</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_SHORT_INT</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_LONG_DOUBLE_INT</code>) which are pairs
-of some basic type and a C <code class="computeroutput">int</code>.
-Unfortunately the MPI specification makes it impossible to look inside
-these types and see where the fields are.  Therefore these wrappers
-assume the types are laid out as <code class="computeroutput">struct { float val;
-int loc; }</code> (for
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_FLOAT_INT</code>), etc, and act
-accordingly.  This appears to be correct at least for Open MPI 1.0.2
-and for Quadrics MPI.</p>
-<p>If <code class="computeroutput">strict</code> is an option specified 
-in <code class="computeroutput">MPIWRAP_DEBUG</code>, the application
-will abort if an unhandled type is encountered.  Otherwise, the 
-application will print a warning message and continue.</p>
-<p>Some effort is made to mark/check memory ranges corresponding to
-arrays of values in a single pass.  This is important for performance
-since asking Valgrind to mark/check any range, no matter how small,
-carries quite a large constant cost.  This optimisation is applied to
-arrays of primitive types (<code class="computeroutput">double</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">float</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">int</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">long</code>, <code class="computeroutput">long
-long</code>, <code class="computeroutput">short</code>,
-<code class="computeroutput">char</code>, and <code class="computeroutput">long
-double</code> on platforms where <code class="computeroutput">sizeof(long
-double) == 8</code>).  For arrays of all other types, the
-wrappers handle each element individually and so there can be a very
-large performance cost.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="4.9.6.Writing new wrappers">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.mpiwrap.writingwrappers"></a>4.9.6.Writing new wrappers</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>
-For the most part the wrappers are straightforward.  The only
-significant complexity arises with nonblocking receives.</p>
-<p>The issue is that <code class="computeroutput">MPI_Irecv</code>
-states the recv buffer and returns immediately, giving a handle
-(<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Request</code>) for the transaction.
-Later the user will have to poll for completion with
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Wait</code> etc, and when the
-transaction completes successfully, the wrappers have to paint the
-recv buffer.  But the recv buffer details are not presented to
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Wait</code> -- only the handle is.  The
-library therefore maintains a shadow table which associates
-uncompleted <code class="computeroutput">MPI_Request</code>s with the
-corresponding buffer address/count/type.  When an operation completes,
-the table is searched for the associated address/count/type info, and
-memory is marked accordingly.</p>
-<p>Access to the table is guarded by a (POSIX pthreads) lock, so as
-to make the library thread-safe.</p>
-<p>The table is allocated with
-<code class="computeroutput">malloc</code> and never
-<code class="computeroutput">free</code>d, so it will show up in leak
-checks.</p>
-<p>Writing new wrappers should be fairly easy.  The source file is
-<code class="computeroutput">mpi/libmpiwrap.c</code>.  If possible,
-find an existing wrapper for a function of similar behaviour to the
-one you want to wrap, and use it as a starting point.  The wrappers
-are organised in sections in the same order as the MPI 1.1 spec, to
-aid navigation.  When adding a wrapper, remember to comment out the
-definition of the default wrapper in the long list of defaults at the
-bottom of the file (do not remove it, just comment it out).</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect2" title="4.9.7.What to expect when using the wrappers">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
-<a name="mc-manual.mpiwrap.whattoexpect"></a>4.9.7.What to expect when using the wrappers</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>The wrappers should reduce Memcheck's false-error rate on MPI
-applications.  Because the wrapping is done at the MPI interface,
-there will still potentially be a large number of errors reported in
-the MPI implementation below the interface.  The best you can do is
-try to suppress them.</p>
-<p>You may also find that the input-side (buffer
-length/definedness) checks find errors in your MPI use, for example
-passing too short a buffer to
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Recv</code>.</p>
-<p>Functions which are not wrapped may increase the false
-error rate.  A possible approach is to run with
-<code class="computeroutput">MPI_DEBUG</code> containing
-<code class="computeroutput">warn</code>.  This will show you functions
-which lack proper wrappers but which are nevertheless used.  You can
-then write wrappers for them.
-</p>
-<p>A known source of potential false errors are the
-<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Reduce</code> family of functions, when
-using a custom (user-defined) reduction function.  In a reduction
-operation, each node notionally sends data to a "central point" which
-uses the specified reduction function to merge the data items into a
-single item.  Hence, in general, data is passed between nodes and fed
-to the reduction function, but the wrapper library cannot mark the
-transferred data as initialised before it is handed to the reduction
-function, because all that happens "inside" the
-<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Reduce</code> call.  As a result you
-may see false positives reported in your reduction function.</p>

-<p>Heap profiling can help you reduce the amount of memory your program
-uses.  On modern machines with virtual memory, this provides the following
-benefits:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>It can speed up your program -- a smaller
-    program will interact better with your machine's caches and
-    avoid paging.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>If your program uses lots of memory, it will
-    reduce the chance that it exhausts your machine's swap
-    space.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>Also, there are certain space leaks that aren't detected by
-traditional leak-checkers, such as Memcheck's.  That's because
-the memory isn't ever actually lost -- a pointer remains to it --
-but it's not in use.  Programs that have leaks like this can
-unnecessarily increase the amount of memory they are using over
-time.  Massif can help identify these leaks.</p>
-<p>Importantly, Massif tells you not only how much heap memory your
-program is using, it also gives very detailed information that indicates
-which parts of your program are responsible for allocating the heap memory.

-<p>First off, as for the other Valgrind tools, you should compile with
-debugging info (the <code class="option">-g</code> option).  It shouldn't
-matter much what optimisation level you compile your program with, as this
-is unlikely to affect the heap memory usage.</p>
-<p>Then, you need to run Massif itself to gather the profiling

-<p>Why is most of the graph empty, with only a couple of bars at the very
-end?  By default, Massif uses "instructions executed" as the unit of time.
-For very short-run programs such as the example, most of the executed
-instructions involve the loading and dynamic linking of the program.  The
-execution of <code class="computeroutput">main</code> (and thus the heap
-allocations) only occur at the very end.  For a short-running program like
-this, we can use the <code class="option">--time-unit=B</code> option
-to specify that we want the time unit to instead be the number of bytes
-allocated/deallocated on the heap and stack(s).</p>
-<p>If we re-run the program under Massif with this option, and then
-re-run ms_print, we get this more useful graph:</p>

-<p>The size of the graph can be changed with ms_print's
-<code class="option">--x</code> and <code class="option">--y</code> options.  Each vertical bar
-represents a snapshot, i.e. a measurement of the memory usage at a certain
-point in time.  If the next snapshot is more than one column away, a
-horizontal line of characters is drawn from the top of the snapshot to just
-before the next snapshot column.  The text at the bottom show that 25
-snapshots were taken for this program, which is one per heap
-allocation/deallocation, plus a couple of extras.  Massif starts by taking
-snapshots for every heap allocation/deallocation, but as a program runs for
-longer, it takes snapshots less frequently.  It also discards older
-snapshots as the program goes on;  when it reaches the maximum number of
-snapshots (100 by default, although changeable with the
-<code class="option">--max-snapshots</code> option) half of them are
-deleted.  This means that a reasonable number of snapshots are always
-maintained.</p>
-<p>Most snapshots are <span class="emphasis"><em>normal</em></span>, and only basic
-information is recorded for them.  Normal snapshots are represented in the
-graph by bars consisting of ':' characters.</p>
-<p>Some snapshots are <span class="emphasis"><em>detailed</em></span>.  Information about
-where allocations happened are recorded for these snapshots, as we will see
-shortly.  Detailed snapshots are represented in the graph by bars consisting
-of '@' characters.  The text at the bottom show that 3 detailed
-snapshots were taken for this program (snapshots 9, 14 and 24).  By default,
-every 10th snapshot is detailed, although this can be changed via the
-<code class="option">--detailed-freq</code> option.</p>
-<p>Finally, there is at most one <span class="emphasis"><em>peak</em></span> snapshot.  The
-peak snapshot is a detailed snapshot, and records the point where memory
-consumption was greatest.  The peak snapshot is represented in the graph by
-a bar consisting of '#' characters.  The text at the bottom shows
-that snapshot 14 was the peak.</p>
-<p>Massif's determination of when the peak occurred can be wrong, for
-two reasons.</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>Peak snapshots are only ever taken after a deallocation
-  happens.  This avoids lots of unnecessary peak snapshot recordings
-  (imagine what happens if your program allocates a lot of heap blocks in
-  succession, hitting a new peak every time).  But it means that if your
-  program never deallocates any blocks, no peak will be recorded.  It also
-  means that if your program does deallocate blocks but later allocates to a
-  higher peak without subsequently deallocating, the reported peak will be
-  too low.
-  </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Even with this behaviour, recording the peak accurately
-  is slow.  So by default Massif records a peak whose size is within 1% of
-  the size of the true peak.  This inaccuracy in the peak measurement can be
-  changed with the <code class="option">--peak-inaccuracy</code> option.</p></li>

-<p>The number of extra heap bytes allocated at that point.
-  This reflects the number of bytes allocated in excess of what the program
-  asked for.  There are two sources of extra heap bytes.</p>
-<p>First, every heap block has administrative bytes associated with it.
-  The exact number of administrative bytes depends on the details of the
-  allocator.  By default Massif assumes 8 bytes per block, as can be seen
-  from the example, but this number can be changed via the
-  <code class="option">--heap-admin</code> option.</p>
-<p>Second, allocators often round up the number of bytes asked for to a
-  larger number, usually 8 or 16.  This is required to ensure that elements
-  within the block are suitably aligned.  If N bytes are asked for, Massif
-  rounds N up to the nearest multiple of the value specified by the

-<p>The next snapshot is detailed.  As well as the basic counts, it gives
-an allocation tree which indicates exactly which pieces of code were
-responsible for allocating heap memory:</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-  9          9,072            9,072            9,000            72            0

-</pre>
-<p>The allocation tree can be read from the top down.  The first line
-indicates all heap allocation functions such as <code class="function">malloc</code>
-and C++ <code class="function">new</code>.  All heap allocations go through these
-functions, and so all 9,000 useful bytes (which is 99.21% of all allocated
-bytes) go through them.  But how were <code class="function">malloc</code> and new
-called?  At this point, every allocation so far has been due to line 20
-inside <code class="function">main</code>, hence the second line in the tree.  The
-<code class="option">-&gt;</code> indicates that main (line 20) called
-<code class="function">malloc</code>.</p>
-<p>Let's see what the subsequent output shows happened next:</p>

-</pre>
-<p>The first four snapshots are similar to the previous ones.  But then
-the global allocation peak is reached, and a detailed snapshot (number 14)
-is taken.  Its allocation tree shows that 20,000B of useful heap memory has
-been allocated, and the lines and arrows indicate that this is from three
-different code locations: line 20, which is responsible for 10,000B
-(49.74%);  line 5, which is responsible for 8,000B (39.79%); and line 10,
-which is responsible for 2,000B (9.95%).</p>
-<p>We can then drill down further in the allocation tree.  For example,
-of the 8,000B asked for by line 5, half of it was due to a call from line
-11, and half was due to a call from line 25.</p>
-<p>In short, Massif collates the stack trace of every single allocation
-point in the program into a single tree, which gives a complete picture at
-a particular point in time of how and why all heap memory was
-allocated.</p>
-<p>Note that the tree entries correspond not to functions, but to
-individual code locations.  For example, if function <code class="function">A</code>
-calls <code class="function">malloc</code>, and function <code class="function">B</code> calls
-<code class="function">A</code> twice, once on line 10 and once on line 11, then
-the two calls will result in two distinct stack traces in the tree.  In
-contrast, if <code class="function">B</code> calls <code class="function">A</code> repeatedly
-from line 15 (e.g. due to a loop), then each of those calls will be
-represented by the same stack trace in the tree.</p>
-<p>Note also that each tree entry with children in the example satisfies an
-invariant: the entry's size is equal to the sum of its children's sizes.
-For example, the first entry has size 20,000B, and its children have sizes
-10,000B, 8,000B, and 2,000B.  In general, this invariant almost always
-holds.  However, in rare circumstances stack traces can be malformed, in
-which case a stack trace can be a sub-trace of another stack trace.  This
-means that some entries in the tree may not satisfy the invariant -- the
-entry's size will be greater than the sum of its children's sizes.  This is
-not a big problem, but could make the results confusing.  Massif can
-sometimes detect when this happens;  if it does, it issues a warning:</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-Warning: Malformed stack trace detected.  In Massif's output,
-         the size of an entry's child entries may not sum up
-         to the entry's size as they normally do.
-</pre>
-<p>However, Massif does not detect and warn about every such occurrence.
-Fortunately, malformed stack traces are rare in practice.</p>
-<p>Returning now to ms_print's output, the final part is similar:</p>

-<p>
-It is worth emphasising that by default Massif measures only heap memory, i.e.
-memory allocated with
-<code class="function">malloc</code>,
-<code class="function">calloc</code>,
-<code class="function">realloc</code>,
-<code class="function">memalign</code>,
-<code class="function">new</code>,
-<code class="function">new[]</code>,
-and a few other, similar functions.  (And it can optionally measure stack
-memory, of course.)  This means it does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> directly
-measure memory allocated with lower-level system calls such as
-<code class="function">mmap</code>,
-<code class="function">mremap</code>, and
-<code class="function">brk</code>.  
-</p>
-<p>
-Heap allocation functions such as <code class="function">malloc</code> are built on
-top of these system calls.  For example, when needed, an allocator will
-typically call <code class="function">mmap</code> to allocate a large chunk of
-memory, and then hand over pieces of that memory chunk to the client program
-in response to calls to <code class="function">malloc</code> et al.  Massif directly
-measures only these higher-level <code class="function">malloc</code> et al calls,
-not the lower-level system calls.
-</p>
-<p>
-Furthermore, a client program may use these lower-level system calls
-directly to allocate memory.  By default, Massif does not measure these.  Nor
-does it measure the size of code, data and BSS segments.  Therefore, the
-numbers reported by Massif may be significantly smaller than those reported by
-tools such as <code class="filename">top</code> that measure a program's total size in
-memory.
-</p>
-<p>
-However, if you wish to measure <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the memory used by
-your program, you can use the <code class="option">--pages-as-heap=yes</code>.  When this
-option is enabled, Massif's normal heap block profiling is replaced by
-lower-level page profiling.  Every page allocated via
-<code class="function">mmap</code> and similar system calls is treated as a distinct
-block.  This means that code, data and BSS segments are all measured, as they
-are just memory pages.  Even the stack is measured, since it is ultimately
-allocated (and extended when necessary) via <code class="function">mmap</code>;  for
-this reason <code class="option">--stacks=yes</code> is not allowed in conjunction with
-<code class="option">--pages-as-heap=yes</code>.
-</p>
-<p>
-After <code class="option">--pages-as-heap=yes</code> is used, ms_print's output is
-mostly unchanged.  One difference is that the start of each detailed snapshot
-says:
-</p>
-<pre class="screen">
-(page allocation syscalls) mmap/mremap/brk, --alloc-fns, etc.
-</pre>
-<p>instead of the usual</p>:
-
-<pre class="screen">
-(heap allocation functions) malloc/new/new[], --alloc-fns, etc.
-</pre>
-<p>
-The stack traces in the output may be more difficult to read, and interpreting
-them may require some detailed understanding of the lower levels of a program
-like the memory allocators.  But for some programs having the full information
-about memory usage can be very useful.

-<a name="ms-manual.acting"></a>9.2.9.Acting on Massif's Information</h3></div></div></div>
-<p>Massif's information is generally fairly easy to act upon.  The
-obvious place to start looking is the peak snapshot.</p>
-<p>It can also be useful to look at the overall shape of the graph, to
-see if memory usage climbs and falls as you expect;  spikes in the graph
-might be worth investigating.</p>
-<p>The detailed snapshots can get quite large.  It is worth viewing them
-in a very wide window.   It's also a good idea to view them with a text
-editor.  That makes it easy to scroll up and down while keeping the cursor
-in a particular column, which makes following the allocation chains easier.

-<p>Functions specified with this option will be treated as though

-      wrappers to <code class="function">malloc</code> or <code class="function">new</code>,
-      which can fill up the allocation trees with uninteresting information.
-      This option can be specified multiple times on the command line, to
-      name multiple functions.</p>
-<p>Note that the named function will only be treated this way if it is
-      the top entry in a stack trace, or just below another function treated
-      this way.  For example, if you have a function
-      <code class="function">malloc1</code> that wraps <code class="function">malloc</code>,
-      and <code class="function">malloc2</code> that wraps
-      <code class="function">malloc1</code>, just specifying
-      <code class="option">--alloc-fn=malloc2</code> will have no effect.  You need to
-      specify <code class="option">--alloc-fn=malloc1</code> as well.  This is a little
-      inconvenient, but the reason is that checking for allocation functions
-      is slow, and it saves a lot of time if Massif can stop looking through
-      the stack trace entries as soon as it finds one that doesn't match
-      rather than having to continue through all the entries.</p>
-<p>Note that C++ names are demangled.  Note also that overloaded
-      C++ names must be written in full.  Single quotes may be necessary to

-<p>Any direct heap allocation (i.e. a call to

-      option) that occurs in a function specified by this option will be

-<p>The Valgrind tool suite provides a number of debugging and
-profiling tools that help you make your programs faster and more correct.
-The most popular of these tools is called Memcheck.  It can detect many
-memory-related errors that are common in C and C++ programs and that can
-lead to crashes and unpredictable behaviour.</p>
-<p>The rest of this guide gives the minimum information you need to start
-detecting memory errors in your program with Memcheck.  For full
-documentation of Memcheck and the other tools, please read the User Manual.
-</p>

-<div class="sect1" title="2.Preparing your program">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="quick-start.prepare"></a>2.Preparing your program</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Compile your program with <code class="option">-g</code> to include debugging
-information so that Memcheck's error messages include exact line
-numbers.  Using <code class="option">-O0</code> is also a good
-idea, if you can tolerate the slowdown.  With
-<code class="option">-O1</code> line numbers in error messages can
-be inaccurate, although generally speaking running Memcheck on code compiled
-at <code class="option">-O1</code> works fairly well, and the speed improvement
-compared to running <code class="option">-O0</code> is quite significant.
-Use of
-<code class="option">-O2</code> and above is not recommended as
-Memcheck occasionally reports uninitialised-value errors which don't
-really exist.</p>

-<p>If you normally run your program like this:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">  myprog arg1 arg2
-</pre>
-<p>Use this command line:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">  valgrind --leak-check=yes myprog arg1 arg2
-</pre>
-<p>Memcheck is the default tool.  The <code class="option">--leak-check</code>
-option turns on the detailed memory leak detector.</p>
-<p>Your program will run much slower (eg. 20 to 30 times) than
-normal, and use a lot more memory.  Memcheck will issue messages about
-memory errors and leaks that it detects.</p>

-<a name="quick-start.interpret"></a>4.Interpreting Memcheck's output</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Here's an example C program, in a file called a.c, with a memory error
-and a memory leak.</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
-
-  void f(void)
-  {
-     int* x = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
-     x[10] = 0;        // problem 1: heap block overrun
-  }                    // problem 2: memory leak -- x not freed
-
-  int main(void)
-  {
-     f();
-     return 0;
-  }
-</pre>
-<p>Most error messages look like the following, which describes
-problem 1, the heap block overrun:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-  ==19182== Invalid write of size 4
-  ==19182==    at 0x804838F: f (example.c:6)
-  ==19182==    by 0x80483AB: main (example.c:11)
-  ==19182==  Address 0x1BA45050 is 0 bytes after a block of size 40 alloc'd
-  ==19182==    at 0x1B8FF5CD: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:130)
-  ==19182==    by 0x8048385: f (example.c:5)
-  ==19182==    by 0x80483AB: main (example.c:11)
-</pre>
-<p>Things to notice:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>There is a lot of information in each error message; read it
-   carefully.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>The 19182 is the process ID;  it's usually unimportant.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>The first line ("Invalid write...") tells you what kind of
-   error it is.  Here, the program wrote to some memory it should not
-   have due to a heap block overrun.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Below the first line is a stack trace telling you where the
-    problem occurred.  Stack traces can get quite large, and be
-    confusing, especially if you are using the C++ STL.  Reading them
-    from the bottom up can help.  If the stack trace is not big enough,
-    use the <code class="option">--num-callers</code> option to make it
-    bigger.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>The code addresses (eg. 0x804838F) are usually unimportant, but
-   occasionally crucial for tracking down weirder bugs.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Some error messages have a second component which describes
-    the memory address involved.  This one shows that the written memory
-    is just past the end of a block allocated with malloc() on line 5 of
-    example.c.</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>It's worth fixing errors in the order they are reported, as
-later errors can be caused by earlier errors.  Failing to do this is a
-common cause of difficulty with Memcheck.</p>
-<p>Memory leak messages look like this:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-  ==19182== 40 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
-  ==19182==    at 0x1B8FF5CD: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:130)
-  ==19182==    by 0x8048385: f (a.c:5)
-  ==19182==    by 0x80483AB: main (a.c:11)
-</pre>
-<p>The stack trace tells you where the leaked memory was allocated.
-Memcheck cannot tell you why the memory leaked, unfortunately.
-(Ignore the "vg_replace_malloc.c", that's an implementation
-detail.)</p>
-<p>There are several kinds of leaks; the two most important
-categories are:</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>"definitely lost": your program is leaking memory -- fix
-    it!</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>"probably lost": your program is leaking memory, unless you're
-    doing funny things with pointers (such as moving them to point to
-    the middle of a heap block).</p></li>
-</ul></div>
-<p>Memcheck also reports uses of uninitialised values, most commonly with
-the message "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised
-value(s)".  It can be difficult to determine the root cause of these errors.
-Try using the <code class="option">--track-origins=yes</code> to get extra information.
-This makes Memcheck run slower, but the extra information you get often
-saves a lot of time figuring out where the uninitialised values are coming
-from.</p>
-<p>If you don't understand an error message, please consult
-<a class="xref" href="mc-manual.html#mc-manual.errormsgs" title="4.2.Explanation of error messages from Memcheck">Explanation of error messages from Memcheck</a> in the <a class="xref" href="manual.html" title="Valgrind User Manual">Valgrind User Manual</a>

-<div class="sect1" title="5.Caveats">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="quick-start.caveats"></a>5.Caveats</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>Memcheck is not perfect;  it occasionally produces false positives,
-and there are mechanisms for suppressing these (see 
-<a class="xref" href="manual-core.html#manual-core.suppress" title="2.5.Suppressing errors">Suppressing errors</a> in the <a class="xref" href="manual.html" title="Valgrind User Manual">Valgrind User Manual</a>).
-However, it is typically right 99% of the time, so you should be wary of
-ignoring its error messages.  After all, you wouldn't ignore warning
-messages produced by a compiler, right?  The suppression mechanism is
-also useful if Memcheck is reporting errors in library code that you
-cannot change.  The default suppression set hides a lot of these, but you
-may come across more.</p>
-<p>Memcheck cannot detect every memory error your program has.
-For example, it can't detect out-of-range reads or writes to arrays
-that are allocated statically or on the stack.  But it should detect many
-errors that could crash your program (eg. cause a segmentation
-fault).</p>
-<p>Try to make your program so clean that Memcheck reports no
-errors.  Once you achieve this state, it is much easier to see when
-changes to the program cause Memcheck to report new errors.
-Experience from several years of Memcheck use shows that it is
-possible to make even huge programs run Memcheck-clean.  For example,
-large parts of KDE, OpenOffice.org and Firefox are Memcheck-clean, or very
-close to it.</p>

-<p>SGCheck is a tool for finding overruns of stack and global
-arrays.  It works by using a heuristic approach derived from an
-observation about the likely forms of stack and global array accesses.

-<a name="sg-manual.how-works.sg-checks"></a>11.3.How SGCheck Works</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>When a source file is compiled
-with <code class="option">-g</code>, the compiler attaches DWARF3
-debugging information which describes the location of all stack and
-global arrays in the file.</p>
-<p>Checking of accesses to such arrays would then be relatively
-simple, if the compiler could also tell us which array (if any) each
-memory referencing instruction was supposed to access.  Unfortunately
-the DWARF3 debugging format does not provide a way to represent such
-information, so we have to resort to a heuristic technique to
-approximate it.  The key observation is that
-   <span class="emphasis"><em>
-   if a memory referencing instruction accesses inside a stack or
-   global array once, then it is highly likely to always access that
-   same array</em></span>.</p>
-<p>To see how this might be useful, consider the following buggy
-fragment:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-   { int i, a[10];  // both are auto vars
-     for (i = 0; i &lt;= 10; i++)
-        a[i] = 42;
-   }
-</pre>
-<p>At run time we will know the precise address
-of <code class="computeroutput">a[]</code> on the stack, and so we can
-observe that the first store resulting from <code class="computeroutput">a[i] =
-42</code> writes <code class="computeroutput">a[]</code>, and
-we will (correctly) assume that that instruction is intended always to
-access <code class="computeroutput">a[]</code>.  Then, on the 11th
-iteration, it accesses somewhere else, possibly a different local,
-possibly an un-accounted for area of the stack (eg, spill slot), so
-SGCheck reports an error.</p>
-<p>There is an important caveat.</p>
-<p>Imagine a function such as <code class="function">memcpy</code>, which is used
-to read and write many different areas of memory over the lifetime of the
-program.  If we insist that the read and write instructions in its memory
-copying loop only ever access one particular stack or global variable, we
-will be flooded with errors resulting from calls to
-<code class="function">memcpy</code>.</p>
-<p>To avoid this problem, SGCheck instantiates fresh likely-target
-records for each entry to a function, and discards them on exit.  This
-allows detection of cases where (e.g.) <code class="function">memcpy</code>
-overflows its source or destination buffers for any specific call, but
-does not carry any restriction from one call to the next.  Indeed,
-multiple threads may make multiple simultaneous calls to
-(e.g.) <code class="function">memcpy</code> without mutual interference.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect1" title="11.4.Comparison with Memcheck">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="sg-manual.cmp-w-memcheck"></a>11.4.Comparison with Memcheck</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>SGCheck and Memcheck are complementary: their capabilities do
-not overlap.  Memcheck performs bounds checks and use-after-free
-checks for heap arrays.  It also finds uses of uninitialised values
-created by heap or stack allocations.  But it does not perform bounds
-checking for stack or global arrays.</p>
-<p>SGCheck, on the other hand, does do bounds checking for stack or
-global arrays, but it doesn't do anything else.</p>
-</div>
-<div class="sect1" title="11.5.Limitations">
-<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
-<a name="sg-manual.limitations"></a>11.5.Limitations</h2></div></div></div>
-<p>This is an experimental tool, which relies rather too heavily on some
-not-as-robust-as-I-would-like assumptions on the behaviour of correct
-programs.  There are a number of limitations which you should be aware
-of.</p>
-<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
-<li class="listitem"><p>False negatives (missed errors): it follows from the
-   description above (<a class="xref" href="sg-manual.html#sg-manual.how-works.sg-checks" title="11.3.How SGCheck Works">How SGCheck Works</a>)
-   that the first access by a memory referencing instruction to a
-   stack or global array creates an association between that
-   instruction and the array, which is checked on subsequent accesses
-   by that instruction, until the containing function exits.  Hence,
-   the first access by an instruction to an array (in any given
-   function instantiation) is not checked for overrun, since SGCheck
-   uses that as the "example" of how subsequent accesses should
-   behave.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>False positives (false errors): similarly, and more serious,
-   it is clearly possible to write legitimate pieces of code which
-   break the basic assumption upon which the checking algorithm
-   depends.  For example:</p>
-<pre class="programlisting">
-  { int a[10], b[10], *p, i;
-    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
-       p = /* arbitrary condition */  ? &amp;a[i]  : &amp;b[i];
-       *p = 42;
-    }
-  }
-</pre>
-<p>In this case the store sometimes
-   accesses <code class="computeroutput">a[]</code> and
-   sometimes <code class="computeroutput">b[]</code>, but in no cases is
-   the addressed array overrun.  Nevertheless the change in target
-   will cause an error to be reported.</p>
-<p>It is hard to see how to get around this problem.  The only
-   mitigating factor is that such constructions appear very rare, at
-   least judging from the results using the tool so far.  Such a
-   construction appears only once in the Valgrind sources (running
-   Valgrind on Valgrind) and perhaps two or three times for a start
-   and exit of Firefox.  The best that can be done is to suppress the
-   errors.</p>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Performance: SGCheck has to read all of
-   the DWARF3 type and variable information on the executable and its
-   shared objects.  This is computationally expensive and makes
-   startup quite slow.  You can expect debuginfo reading time to be in
-   the region of a minute for an OpenOffice sized application, on a
-   2.4 GHz Core 2 machine.  Reading this information also requires a
-   lot of memory.  To make it viable, SGCheck goes to considerable
-   trouble to compress the in-memory representation of the DWARF3
-   data, which is why the process of reading it appears slow.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Performance: SGCheck runs slower than Memcheck.  This is
-   partly due to a lack of tuning, but partly due to algorithmic
-   difficulties.  The
-   stack and global checks can sometimes require a number of range
-   checks per memory access, and these are difficult to short-circuit,
-   despite considerable efforts having been made.  A
-   redesign and reimplementation could potentially make it much faster.
-   </p></li>
-<li class="listitem">
-<p>Coverage: Stack and global checking is fragile.  If a shared
-   object does not have debug information attached, then SGCheck will
-   not be able to determine the bounds of any stack or global arrays
-   defined within that shared object, and so will not be able to check
-   accesses to them.  This is true even when those arrays are accessed
-   from some other shared object which was compiled with debug
-   info.</p>
-<p>At the moment SGCheck accepts objects lacking debuginfo
-   without comment.  This is dangerous as it causes SGCheck to
-   silently skip stack and global checking for such objects.  It would
-   be better to print a warning in such circumstances.</p>
-</li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Coverage: SGCheck does not check whether the the areas read
-   or written by system calls do overrun stack or global arrays.  This
-   would be easy to add.</p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Platforms: the stack/global checks won't work properly on
-   PowerPC, ARM or S390X platforms, only on X86 and AMD64 targets.
-   That's because the stack and global checking requires tracking
-   function calls and exits reliably, and there's no obvious way to do
-   it on ABIs that use a link register for function returns.
-   </p></li>
-<li class="listitem"><p>Robustness: related to the previous point.  Function
-   call/exit tracking for X86 and AMD64 is believed to work properly
-   even in the presence of longjmps within the same stack (although
-   this has not been tested).  However, code which switches stacks is
-   likely to cause breakage/chaos.</p></li>

-.SH "NAME"
-valgrind \- a suite of tools for debugging and profiling programs
-.SH "SYNOPSIS"
-.HP \w'\fBvalgrind\fR\ 'u
-\fBvalgrind\fR [\fIvalgrind\-options\fR] [\fByour\-program\fR] [\fIyour\-program\-options\fR]
-.SH "DESCRIPTION"
-.PP
-\fBValgrind\fR
-is a flexible program for debugging and profiling Linux executables\&. It consists of a core, which provides a synthetic CPU in software, and a series of debugging and profiling tools\&. The architecture is modular, so that new tools can be created easily and without disturbing the existing structure\&.
-.PP
-Some of the options described below work with all Valgrind tools, and some only work with a few or one\&. The section MEMCHECK OPTIONS and those below it describe tool\-specific options\&.
-.PP
-This manual page covers only basic usage and options\&. For more comprehensive information, please see the HTML documentation on your system:
-$INSTALL/share/doc/valgrind/html/index\&.html, or online:
-http://www\&.valgrind\&.org/docs/manual/index\&.html\&.
-.SH "TOOL SELECTION OPTIONS"
-.PP
-The single most important option\&.
-.PP
-\fB\-\-tool=<toolname> [default: memcheck] \fR
-.RS 4
-Run the Valgrind tool called
-\fItoolname\fR, e\&.g\&. Memcheck, Cachegrind, etc\&.
-.RE
-.SH "BASIC OPTIONS"
-.PP
-These options work with all tools\&.
-.PP
-\fB\-h \-\-help\fR
-.RS 4
-Show help for all options, both for the core and for the selected tool\&. If the option is repeated it is equivalent to giving
-\fB\-\-help\-debug\fR\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-help\-debug\fR
-.RS 4
-Same as
-\fB\-\-help\fR, but also lists debugging options which usually are only of use to Valgrind\*(Aqs developers\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-version\fR
-.RS 4
-Show the version number of the Valgrind core\&. Tools can have their own version numbers\&. There is a scheme in place to ensure that tools only execute when the core version is one they are known to work with\&. This was done to minimise the chances of strange problems arising from tool\-vs\-core version incompatibilities\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
-.RS 4
-Run silently, and only print error messages\&. Useful if you are running regression tests or have some other automated test machinery\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
-.RS 4
-Be more verbose\&. Gives extra information on various aspects of your program, such as: the shared objects loaded, the suppressions used, the progress of the instrumentation and execution engines, and warnings about unusual behaviour\&. Repeating the option increases the verbosity level\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-trace\-children=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
-.RS 4
-When enabled, Valgrind will trace into sub\-processes initiated via the
-\fIexec\fR
-system call\&. This is necessary for multi\-process programs\&.
-.sp
-Note that Valgrind does trace into the child of a
-\fIfork\fR
-(it would be difficult not to, since
-\fIfork\fR
-makes an identical copy of a process), so this option is arguably badly named\&. However, most children of
-\fIfork\fR
-calls immediately call
-\fIexec\fR
-anyway\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-trace\-children\-skip=patt1,patt2,\&.\&.\&. \fR
-.RS 4
-This option only has an effect when
-\fB\-\-trace\-children=yes\fR
-is specified\&. It allows for some children to be skipped\&. The option takes a comma separated list of patterns for the names of child executables that Valgrind should not trace into\&. Patterns may include the metacharacters
-?
-and
-*, which have the usual meaning\&.
-.sp
-This can be useful for pruning uninteresting branches from a tree of processes being run on Valgrind\&. But you should be careful when using it\&. When Valgrind skips tracing into an executable, it doesn\*(Aqt just skip tracing that executable, it also skips tracing any of that executable\*(Aqs child processes\&. In other words, the flag doesn\*(Aqt merely cause tracing to stop at the specified executables \-\- it skips tracing of entire process subtrees rooted at any of the specified executables\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-trace\-children\-skip\-by\-arg=patt1,patt2,\&.\&.\&. \fR
-.RS 4
-This is the same as
-\fB\-\-trace\-children\-skip\fR, with one difference: the decision as to whether to trace into a child process is made by examining the arguments to the child process, rather than the name of its executable\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-child\-silent\-after\-fork=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
-.RS 4
-When enabled, Valgrind will not show any debugging or logging output for the child process resulting from a
-\fIfork\fR
-call\&. This can make the output less confusing (although more misleading) when dealing with processes that create children\&. It is particularly useful in conjunction with
-\fI\-\-trace\-children=\fR\&. Use of this option is also strongly recommended if you are requesting XML output (\fI\-\-xml=yes\fR), since otherwise the XML from child and parent may become mixed up, which usually makes it useless\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-vgdb=<no|yes|full> [default: yes] \fR
-.RS 4
-Valgrind will provide "gdbserver" functionality when
-\fB\-\-vgdb=yes\fR
-or
-\fB\-\-vgdb=full\fR
-is specified\&. This allows an external GNU GDB debugger to control and debug your program when it runs on Valgrind\&.
-\fB\-\-vgdb=full\fR
-incurs significant performance overheads, but provides more precise breakpoints and watchpoints\&. See
-???
-for a detailed description\&.
-.sp
-If the embedded gdbserver is enabled but no gdb is currently being used, the
-???
-command line utility can send "monitor commands" to Valgrind from a shell\&. The Valgrind core provides a set of
-???\&. A tool can optionally provide tool specific monitor commands, which are documented in the tool specific chapter\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-vgdb\-error=<number> [default: 999999999] \fR
-.RS 4
-Use this option when the Valgrind gdbserver is enabled with
-\fB\-\-vgdb=yes\fR
-or
-\fB\-\-vgdb=full\fR\&. Tools that report errors will wait for "number" errors to be reported before freezing the program and waiting for you to connect with GDB\&. It follows that a value of zero will cause the gdbserver to be started before your program is executed\&. This is typically used to insert GDB breakpoints before execution, and also works with tools that do not report errors, such as Massif\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-track\-fds=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
-.RS 4
-When enabled, Valgrind will print out a list of open file descriptors on exit\&. Along with each file descriptor is printed a stack backtrace of where the file was opened and any details relating to the file descriptor such as the file name or socket details\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-time\-stamp=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
-.RS 4
-When enabled, each message is preceded with an indication of the elapsed wallclock time since startup, expressed as days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-log\-fd=<number> [default: 2, stderr] \fR
-.RS 4
-Specifies that Valgrind should send all of its messages to the specified file descriptor\&. The default, 2, is the standard error channel (stderr)\&. Note that this may interfere with the client\*(Aqs own use of stderr, as Valgrind\*(Aqs output will be interleaved with any output that the client sends to stderr\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-log\-file=<filename> \fR
-.RS 4
-Specifies that Valgrind should send all of its messages to the specified file\&. If the file name is empty, it causes an abort\&. There are three special format specifiers that can be used in the file name\&.
-.sp
-\fB%p\fR
-is replaced with the current process ID\&. This is very useful for program that invoke multiple processes\&. WARNING: If you use
-\fB\-\-trace\-children=yes\fR
-and your program invokes multiple processes OR your program forks without calling exec afterwards, and you don\*(Aqt use this specifier (or the
-\fB%q\fR
-specifier below), the Valgrind output from all those processes will go into one file, possibly jumbled up, and possibly incomplete\&.
-.sp
-\fB%q{FOO}\fR
-is replaced with the contents of the environment variable
-\fIFOO\fR\&. If the
-\fB{FOO}\fR
-part is malformed, it causes an abort\&. This specifier is rarely needed, but very useful in certain circumstances (eg\&. when running MPI programs)\&. The idea is that you specify a variable which will be set differently for each process in the job, for example
-BPROC_RANK
-or whatever is applicable in your MPI setup\&. If the named environment variable is not set, it causes an abort\&. Note that in some shells, the
-\fB{\fR
-and
-\fB}\fR
-characters may need to be escaped with a backslash\&.
-.sp
-\fB%%\fR
-is replaced with
-\fB%\fR\&.
-.sp
-If an
-\fB%\fR
-is followed by any other character, it causes an abort\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-log\-socket=<ip\-address:port\-number> \fR
-.RS 4
-Specifies that Valgrind should send all of its messages to the specified port at the specified IP address\&. The port may be omitted, in which case port 1500 is used\&. If a connection cannot be made to the specified socket, Valgrind falls back to writing output to the standard error (stderr)\&. This option is intended to be used in conjunction with the
-valgrind\-listener
-program\&. For further details, see
-the commentary
-in the manual\&.
-.RE
-.SH "ERROR-RELATED OPTIONS"
-.PP
-These options are used by all tools that can report errors, e\&.g\&. Memcheck, but not Cachegrind\&.
-.PP
-\fB\-\-xml=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
-.RS 4
-When enabled, the important parts of the output (e\&.g\&. tool error messages) will be in XML format rather than plain text\&. Furthermore, the XML output will be sent to a different output channel than the plain text output\&. Therefore, you also must use one of
-\fB\-\-xml\-fd\fR,
-\fB\-\-xml\-file\fR
-or
-\fB\-\-xml\-socket\fR
-to specify where the XML is to be sent\&.
-.sp
-Less important messages will still be printed in plain text, but because the XML output and plain text output are sent to different output channels (the destination of the plain text output is still controlled by
-\fB\-\-log\-fd\fR,
-\fB\-\-log\-file\fR
-and
-\fB\-\-log\-socket\fR) this should not cause problems\&.
-.sp
-This option is aimed at making life easier for tools that consume Valgrind\*(Aqs output as input, such as GUI front ends\&. Currently this option works with Memcheck, Helgrind, DRD and SGcheck\&. The output format is specified in the file
-docs/internals/xml\-output\-protocol4\&.txt
-in the source tree for Valgrind 3\&.5\&.0 or later\&.
-.sp
-The recommended options for a GUI to pass, when requesting XML output, are:
-\fB\-\-xml=yes\fR
-to enable XML output,
-\fB\-\-xml\-file\fR
-to send the XML output to a (presumably GUI\-selected) file,
-\fB\-\-log\-file\fR
-to send the plain text output to a second GUI\-selected file,
-\fB\-\-child\-silent\-after\-fork=yes\fR, and
-\fB\-q\fR
-to restrict the plain text output to critical error messages created by Valgrind itself\&. For example, failure to read a specified suppressions file counts as a critical error message\&. In this way, for a successful run the text output file will be empty\&. But if it isn\*(Aqt empty, then it will contain important information which the GUI user should be made aware of\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-xml\-fd=<number> [default: \-1, disabled] \fR
-.RS 4
-Specifies that Valgrind should send its XML output to the specified file descriptor\&. It must be used in conjunction with
-\fB\-\-xml=yes\fR\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-xml\-file=<filename> \fR
-.RS 4
-Specifies that Valgrind should send its XML output to the specified file\&. It must be used in conjunction with
-\fB\-\-xml=yes\fR\&. Any
-\fB%p\fR
-or
-\fB%q\fR
-sequences appearing in the filename are expanded in exactly the same way as they are for
-\fB\-\-log\-file\fR\&. See the description of
-\fB\-\-log\-file\fR
-for details\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-xml\-socket=<ip\-address:port\-number> \fR
-.RS 4
-Specifies that Valgrind should send its XML output the specified port at the specified IP address\&. It must be used in conjunction with
-\fB\-\-xml=yes\fR\&. The form of the argument is the same as that used by
-\fB\-\-log\-socket\fR\&. See the description of
-\fB\-\-log\-socket\fR
-for further details\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-xml\-user\-comment=<string> \fR
-.RS 4
-Embeds an extra user comment string at the start of the XML output\&. Only works when
-\fB\-\-xml=yes\fR
-is specified; ignored otherwise\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-demangle=<yes|no> [default: yes] \fR
-.RS 4
-Enable/disable automatic demangling (decoding) of C++ names\&. Enabled by default\&. When enabled, Valgrind will attempt to translate encoded C++ names back to something approaching the original\&. The demangler handles symbols mangled by g++ versions 2\&.X, 3\&.X and 4\&.X\&.
-.sp
-An important fact about demangling is that function names mentioned in suppressions files should be in their mangled form\&. Valgrind does not demangle function names when searching for applicable suppressions, because to do otherwise would make suppression file contents dependent on the state of Valgrind\*(Aqs demangling machinery, and also slow down suppression matching\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-num\-callers=<number> [default: 12] \fR
-.RS 4
-Specifies the maximum number of entries shown in stack traces that identify program locations\&. Note that errors are commoned up using only the top four function locations (the place in the current function, and that of its three immediate callers)\&. So this doesn\*(Aqt affect the total number of errors reported\&.
-.sp
-The maximum value for this is 500\&. Note that higher settings will make Valgrind run a bit more slowly and take a bit more memory, but can be useful when working with programs with deeply\-nested call chains\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-error\-limit=<yes|no> [default: yes] \fR
-.RS 4
-When enabled, Valgrind stops reporting errors after 10,000,000 in total, or 1,000 different ones, have been seen\&. This is to stop the error tracking machinery from becoming a huge performance overhead in programs with many errors\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-error\-exitcode=<number> [default: 0] \fR
-.RS 4
-Specifies an alternative exit code to return if Valgrind reported any errors in the run\&. When set to the default value (zero), the return value from Valgrind will always be the return value of the process being simulated\&. When set to a nonzero value, that value is returned instead, if Valgrind detects any errors\&. This is useful for using Valgrind as part of an automated test suite, since it makes it easy to detect test cases for which Valgrind has reported errors, just by inspecting return codes\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-show\-below\-main=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
-.RS 4
-By default, stack traces for errors do not show any functions that appear beneath
-\fBmain\fR
-because most of the time it\*(Aqs uninteresting C library stuff and/or gobbledygook\&. Alternatively, if
-\fBmain\fR
-is not present in the stack trace, stack traces will not show any functions below
-\fBmain\fR\-like functions such as glibc\*(Aqs
-\fB__libc_start_main\fR\&. Furthermore, if
-\fBmain\fR\-like functions are present in the trace, they are normalised as
-\fB(below main)\fR, in order to make the output more deterministic\&.
-.sp
-If this option is enabled, all stack trace entries will be shown and
-\fBmain\fR\-like functions will not be normalised\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-fullpath\-after=<string> [default: don\*(Aqt show source paths] \fR
-.RS 4
-By default Valgrind only shows the filenames in stack traces, but not full paths to source files\&. When using Valgrind in large projects where the sources reside in multiple different directories, this can be inconvenient\&.
-\fB\-\-fullpath\-after\fR
-provides a flexible solution to this problem\&. When this option is present, the path to each source file is shown, with the following all\-important caveat: if
-\fBstring\fR
-is found in the path, then the path up to and including
-\fBstring\fR
-is omitted, else the path is shown unmodified\&. Note that
-\fBstring\fR
-is not required to be a prefix of the path\&.
-.sp
-For example, consider a file named
-/home/janedoe/blah/src/foo/bar/xyzzy\&.c\&. Specifying
-\fB\-\-fullpath\-after=/home/janedoe/blah/src/\fR
-will cause Valgrind to show the name as
-foo/bar/xyzzy\&.c\&.
-.sp
-Because the string is not required to be a prefix,
-\fB\-\-fullpath\-after=src/\fR
-will produce the same output\&. This is useful when the path contains arbitrary machine\-generated characters\&. For example, the path
-/my/build/dir/C32A1B47/blah/src/foo/xyzzy
-can be pruned to
-foo/xyzzy
-using
-\fB\-\-fullpath\-after=/blah/src/\fR\&.
-.sp
-If you simply want to see the full path, just specify an empty string:
-\fB\-\-fullpath\-after=\fR\&. This isn\*(Aqt a special case, merely a logical consequence of the above rules\&.
-.sp
-Finally, you can use
-\fB\-\-fullpath\-after\fR
-multiple times\&. Any appearance of it causes Valgrind to switch to producing full paths and applying the above filtering rule\&. Each produced path is compared against all the
-\fB\-\-fullpath\-after\fR\-specified strings, in the order specified\&. The first string to match causes the path to be truncated as described above\&. If none match, the full path is shown\&. This facilitates chopping off prefixes when the sources are drawn from a number of unrelated directories\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-suppressions=<filename> [default: $PREFIX/lib/valgrind/default\&.supp] \fR
-.RS 4
-Specifies an extra file from which to read descriptions of errors to suppress\&. You may use up to 100 extra suppression files\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-gen\-suppressions=<yes|no|all> [default: no] \fR
-.RS 4
-When set to
-\fIyes\fR, Valgrind will pause after every error shown and print the line:
-.sp
-.if n \{\
-.RS 4
-.\}
-.nf
-    \-\-\-\- Print suppression ? \-\-\- [Return/N/n/Y/y/C/c] \-\-\-\-
-.fi
-.if n \{\
-.RE
-.\}
-.sp
-The prompt\*(Aqs behaviour is the same as for the
-\fB\-\-db\-attach\fR
-option (see below)\&.
-.sp
-If you choose to, Valgrind will print out a suppression for this error\&. You can then cut and paste it into a suppression file if you don\*(Aqt want to hear about the error in the future\&.
-.sp
-When set to
-\fIall\fR, Valgrind will print a suppression for every reported error, without querying the user\&.
-.sp
-This option is particularly useful with C++ programs, as it prints out the suppressions with mangled names, as required\&.
-.sp
-Note that the suppressions printed are as specific as possible\&. You may want to common up similar ones, by adding wildcards to function names, and by using frame\-level wildcards\&. The wildcarding facilities are powerful yet flexible, and with a bit of careful editing, you may be able to suppress a whole family of related errors with only a few suppressions\&.
-.sp
-Sometimes two different errors are suppressed by the same suppression, in which case Valgrind will output the suppression more than once, but you only need to have one copy in your suppression file (but having more than one won\*(Aqt cause problems)\&. Also, the suppression name is given as
-<insert a suppression name here>; the name doesn\*(Aqt really matter, it\*(Aqs only used with the
-\fB\-v\fR
-option which prints out all used suppression records\&.
-.RE
-.PP
-\fB\-\-db\-attach=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR

-You may need to use this option if your program has large stack\-allocated arrays\&. Valgrind keeps track of your program\*(Aqs stack pointer\&. If it changes by more than the threshold amount, Valgrind assumes your program is switching to a different stack, and Memcheck behaves differently than it would for a stack pointer change smaller than the threshold\&.

-\fB\-\-smc\-check=<none|stack|all|all\-non\-file> [default: stack] \fR
-.RS 4
-This option controls Valgrind\*(Aqs detection of self\-modifying code\&. If no checking is done, if a program executes some code, then overwrites it with new code, and executes the new code, Valgrind will continue to execute the translations it made for the old code\&. This will likely lead to incorrect behaviour and/or crashes\&.
-.sp
-Valgrind has four levels of self\-modifying code detection: no detection, detect self\-modifying code on the stack (which is used by GCC to implement nested functions), detect self\-modifying code everywhere, and detect self\-modifying code everywhere except in file\-backed mappings\&. Note that the default option will catch the vast majority of cases\&. The main case it will not catch is programs such as JIT compilers that dynamically generate code

-\fIall\fR

-\fBVALGRIND_DISCARD_TRANSLATIONS\fR

-\fB\-\-smc\-check=all\fR

-.sp
-\fB\-\-smc\-check=all\-non\-file\fR
-provides a cheaper but more limited version of
-\fB\-\-smc\-check=all\fR\&. It adds checks to any translations that do not originate from file\-backed memory mappings\&. Typical applications that generate code, for example JITs in web browsers, generate code into anonymous mmaped areas, whereas the "fixed" code of the browser always lives in file\-backed mappings\&.
-\fB\-\-smc\-check=all\-non\-file\fR
-takes advantage of this observation, limiting the overhead of checking to code which is likely to be JIT generated\&.
-.sp
-Some architectures (including ppc32, ppc64, ARM and MIPS) require programs which create code at runtime to flush the instruction cache in between code generation and first use\&. Valgrind observes and honours such instructions\&. Hence, on ppc32/Linux, ppc64/Linux and ARM/Linux, Valgrind always provides complete, transparent support for self\-modifying code\&.

This often makes it difficult to track down the root problem\&.
-.sp
-When set to
-\fIyes\fR, Memcheck keeps track of the origins of all uninitialised values\&. Then, when an uninitialised value error is reported, Memcheck will try to show the origin of the value\&. An origin can be one of the following four places: a heap block, a stack allocation, a client request, or miscellaneous other sources (eg, a call to
-\fIbrk\fR)\&.
-.sp
-For uninitialised values originating from a heap block, Memcheck shows where the block was allocated\&. For uninitialised values originating from a stack allocation, Memcheck can tell you which function allocated the value, but no more than that \-\- typically it shows you the source location of the opening brace of the function\&. So you should carefully check that all of the function\*(Aqs local variables are initialised properly\&.

-Performance overhead: origin tracking is expensive\&. It halves Memcheck\*(Aqs speed and increases memory use by a minimum of 100MB, and possibly more\&.

-Functions specified with this option will be treated as though they were a heap allocation function such as
-\fBmalloc\fR\&. This is useful for functions that are wrappers to
-\fBmalloc\fR
-or
-\fBnew\fR, which can fill up the allocation trees with uninteresting information\&. This option can be specified multiple times on the command line, to name multiple functions\&.
-.sp
-Note that the named function will only be treated this way if it is the top entry in a stack trace, or just below another function treated this way\&. For example, if you have a function
-\fBmalloc1\fR
-that wraps
-\fBmalloc\fR, and
-\fBmalloc2\fR
-that wraps
-\fBmalloc1\fR, just specifying
-\fB\-\-alloc\-fn=malloc2\fR
-will have no effect\&. You need to specify
-\fB\-\-alloc\-fn=malloc1\fR
-as well\&. This is a little inconvenient, but the reason is that checking for allocation functions is slow, and it saves a lot of time if Massif can stop looking through the stack trace entries as soon as it finds one that doesn\*(Aqt match rather than having to continue through all the entries\&.
-.sp
-Note that C++ names are demangled\&. Note also that overloaded C++ names must be written in full\&. Single quotes may be necessary to prevent the shell from breaking them up\&. For example:

-\fB\-\-peak\-inaccuracy=<m\&.n> [default: 1\&.0] \fR
-.RS 4
-Massif does not necessarily record the actual global memory allocation peak; by default it records a peak only when the global memory allocation size exceeds the previous peak by at least 1\&.0%\&. This is because there can be many local allocation peaks along the way, and doing a detailed snapshot for every one would be expensive and wasteful, as all but one of them will be later discarded\&. This inaccuracy can be changed (even to 0\&.0%) via this option, but Massif will run drastically slower as the number approaches zero\&.
